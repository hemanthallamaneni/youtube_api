Someone needs to look into the emissions model estimates as it is not all that clear cut. Many small holder farmers still have small amounts of livestock that are fed with farm produce that cannot be sold or are farm wastes. Rise in the demand for plant based products actually contributed to more farm produce that cannot be sold - consumers usually only pick the nice shiny ones and those that do not make the quality cut are processed or fed to livestock. As for farm wastes, rice bran for example is mixed with feed and rather than letting it decompose, it is used for another purpose to feed animals. This metric on 77% of land used to create 18% of calories also needs to be reviewed since a lot of feed inputs are again wastes being used for another purpose. The opportunity cost way of looking at this problem does not include waste management being used for some other purpose (as input to another process). There are many other examples of farm wastes being used as inputs for animal feed. Then there is the issue of livestock being used in the farm not just to produce meat but as part of the ecosystem - keeping grass cut as to not make an environment for snakes to thrive or ducks eating snails to control snail rice pests. In this case livestock is actually a contributor to make soil richer and make the farm more biodiverse. As for biotechnology on growing meat, how will that play in developing countries? Foster more import culture? Well... there goes accumulation of wealth. This is one of those things that are in the not so simple in life category.']"

The carbon tax has not reduced emissions AT ALL.  In fact emissions have increased.  The trick they use is it was reduced from ""what it would have been"" ie from a computer projection based on past consumption (a guess) that did not take into account other factors that also reduce consumption.  Yes, lower income households do get some more money back, but the fact of the matter is the ""rich"" actually pay less anyway as they leave during winter to warm jurisdictions and avoid the carbon tax anyway (we tend to refer to these people as snow birds).  So who really pays....  The working middle class.  What has the carbon tax really done?  It is a SIGNIFICANT contributor to inflation and the high cost of living particularly in BC. As part of that those who can now burn wood and/or garbage for fuel sources.  These are ""unofficial"" CO2 sources so the ""official"" consumption has gone down, but at best the actual CO2 production is the same or more considering burning wood or garbage for fuel is very inefficient.  It has also significantly contributed to cross boarder shopping mostly into Norther Washington USA where the fuel and products are much more affordable even with our low dollar taken into account.  Other problems are healthy foods like fresh vegetables have gone up significantly in price because of the transport costs.   Forcing families to either forgo or eat (ironically) more processed less healthy foods.  And the high cost of living (among several other factors) has also lead to the extremely high homeless and drug problem in Vancouver in particular.  The economy grew in BC due to demand in LNG and other natural resources (BC has a large forestry industry), and tech centers in Vancouver.  It has not grown as much as it could have mostly due to high taxes, and Provincial and Federal political policies that have limited the economy.  It is above the Canadian average, but it always has been.  I note you did not mention Quebec who also has a carbon tax, but due to it\'s welfare state policies and the rest of Canada\'s monetary support it does not have the higher cost of living, but it also has a stagnant economy.

There are three main types of blood cells: red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes).\n\nRed blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to various tissues and organs, while white blood cells play a crucial role in the immune system, defending the body against infections and diseases. Platelets aid in blood clotting, helping to stop bleeding from wounds.\n\nEach type of blood cell has specific functions, and their proper balance is vital for overall health.

Meaning, once an object gains so much mass that a threshold that gets passed where its gravity is strong enough to teleport the photon so fast from point a to point b that we just can’t see it physically speaking as it travels it’s orbit around the black hole. That’s why some of these black holes have rings of light on them emulating from the elliptical orbit of these photons . Photons that we thought couldn’t be manipulated by gravity to such great measures. Then say a dying star crushes down these atoms into new elements that we have never seen before because of the immense pressures. Something that can be super super condensed and small, giving a massive weight and gravitational pull to an object even though it is much smaller than other objects, its size.

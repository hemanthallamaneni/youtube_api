10,F1zUq5nWAXQ,UN Climate Change:Learn,Guidelines for Integrating Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) into National Adaptation Plans (NAPs),"Strategies that use natural solutions to counter the effects of climate change are known as ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). Despite their benefits, these approaches are not widely used due to a variety of barriers, including a lack of awareness. To help address that, UNEP has released the Guidelines for Integrating Ecosystem-based Adaptation into National Adaptation Plans. 

The document aims to show national and local officials around the world how to integrate EbA into national plans designed to counter the effects of climate change. The guidelines detail the benefits as well as the challenges of adopting ecosystem-based approaches, such as EbA, to climate change adaptation. They also cover what information planners should collect, what expertise is needed and which stakeholders they should engage to successfully integrate ecosystem-based adaptation into national adaptation plans.

The Guidelines have been developed under the National Adaptation Plan Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP), implemented jointly by UNDP and UNEP, which supports the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to identify technical, institutional and financial needs to integrate climate change adaptation into medium- and long-term national planning.

The Guidelines can be accessed and downloaded here:
https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/36703

To support the guidelines, UNEP, UNITAR and partners are developing an e-course Building Climate Resilience through Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) Planning:

In Episode 5, Miranda Schnitger (Ellen MacArthur Foundation), Nilgun Tas (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) and Paula Iharur (CTplas ‚Äì Plastics Technology Centre) provide the answers.","['youth', 'climate change', 'climate action', 'green', 'environment', 'motivational', 'vision', 'solutions', 'future', 'work', 'together', 'global warming', 'pollution', 'COP 25', 'arctic', 'nature', 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'science', 'adaptation', 'paris', 'ice', 'migration', 'music', 'time machine', 'time flies', 'time warp', 'climate crisis', 'youth for climate', 'climate', 'united nations youth climate action summit', 'action', 'climate activism', 'youth climate strike', 'climate call to action', 'young leaders', 'greta', 'podcast', 'green renaissance', 'green economy']",2021-05-17 09:43:15+00:00,241.0,9.0,,0.0,PT45M29S,hd,False,Monday,0 days 00:45:29,40,37.344398340248965,0.0,85

Keeping abreast of the newest developments in climate change is essential to make timely, effective and sustainable decisions. Yet, adequate time and space for learning are rarely accessible for busy delegates, decision-makers and full-time working professional.



This is why we have developed the Climate Classroom - a mobile learning space that ‚Äòpops up‚Äô at the center of major climate change conferences and related events. The Climate Classroom offers focused 45-min learning sessions on highly relevant climate change topics delivered by select experts in English and French. 



During each class, the lecturer and the 20 participants are equipped with noise-cancelling head-sets through which they will be able to follow the lecture and engage in discussion. A booklet with information on the lesson and links to additional learning resources is made available to all learners. Participants completing the sessions receive a UN CC:Learn pin and become part of the Alumni community.","['youth', 'climate change', 'climate action', 'zambia', 'green', 'environment', 'motivational', 'vision', 'solutions', 'future', 'work', 'together', 'global warming', 'pollution', 'COP 25', 'arctic', 'nature', 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'science', 'adaptation', 'paris', 'new york', 'ice', 'migration', 'music', 'time machine', 'time flies', 'time warp', 'climate crisis', 'youth for climate', 'climate', 'united nations youth climate action summit', 'action', 'climate activism', 'youth climate strike', 'time travel', 'this needs to stop', 'climate call to action']",2019-12-06 11:21:55+00:00,105.0,4.0,,0.0,PT57S,hd,False,Friday,0 days 00:00:57,39,38.0952380952381,0.0,24

Tackling climate change will require action at all levels of society, from individuals and educators to public officials, policymakers‚Äã and businesses.

Closing the gap between the scientific and social understanding of climate change is possible only through quality education. Climate education encourages changes in public attitudes and behaviours which consequently leads to greener policies and a more effective low-carbon economy.

Young people from different parts of the world can share their stories and experiences about the local impacts of global warming. The peer-to-peer format of the dialogues creates a space for same level interaction between youth.

124,Xp5p5ATmKi4,ClimateScience - Solve Climate Change,Floating Communities??? #Shorts,"Floating cities may sound like fantasy, but some designers are actually beginning to create structures that embrace rising sea levels. Global sea level rise is expected to exceed two meters by the end of the century if no serious climate action is taken [8]. This has the potential to displace approximately 200 million people [8]. With increasing sea level rise, adaptation solutions to combat it have become essential [7] one of them being floating structures! 

Floating architecture may serve as a solution due to its relatively low economic and logistical maintainability. These afloat settlements could provide safe, climate-resilient housing for flood-stricken communities. Do you think floating architecture could be the game changer in combating sea level rise?

Think of carbon removal as a pollution cleanup operation. For it to work, CO‚ÇÇ must be captured from the atmosphere and stored away safely and permanently without emitting more along the way [1]. 

There are lots of ways to do this: soil carbon sequestration; direct air capture; geological carbon storage; enhanced weathering and more [4,5,6,7].

But it‚Äôs really important to remember: we can‚Äôt let dreams of carbon sequestration delay emissions reduction today. 

Were there any carbon removal methods you were curious about and would like us to cover more deeply? Let us know in the comments! Bye!

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve known since the early 1900s that when we burn carbon-based materials, such as coal or oil, CO2 is released.‚Äù:
https://www.americanscientist.org/article/carbon-dioxide-and-the-climate 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve also known since the 1850s that CO2 is able to trap heat.‚Äù:
https://www.americanscientist.org/article/carbon-dioxide-and-the-climate

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been collecting data about what we burn since the 70s‚Äù:
https://www.eia.gov/about/legislative_timeline.php

‚Äúwe have actually been able to measure the parts per million of co2 for the last 800,000 years!‚Äù:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

‚ÄúWe know this from studying ancient ice cores‚Äù:
https://icecores.org/about-ice-cores

‚ÄúBy analyzing these tiny trapped bubbles of air and knowing how deep they were we can learn about the concentration of CO2 in the air at a given time in the past!‚Äú:
https://icecores.org/about-ice-cores 

‚ÄúBecause of these ice cores we can be pretty sure that the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today is higher than it has been in the past 800,000 years.‚Äù:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

‚Äú We also know that the rate at which the ppm of co2 is increasing is higher than past rates.‚Äù
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

‚ÄúToday, scientists across the globe have set up measuring towers and ocean buoys to record global temperatures 24/7. And guess what? These temperatures have been steadily rising.‚Äù:
https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ten-signs-global-warming 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen glaciers retreating, reduced snow cover, a decline in arctic sea ice, and a resulting rise in sea levels.‚Äù:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 

‚ÄúFrom these models, it's clear that the global changes we are seeing right now cannot be explained by natural phenomena.‚Äù:

5,Xp5p5ATmKi4,ClimateScience - Solve Climate Change,Floating Communities??? #Shorts,"Floating cities may sound like fantasy, but some designers are actually beginning to create structures that embrace rising sea levels. Global sea level rise is expected to exceed two meters by the end of the century if no serious climate action is taken [8]. This has the potential to displace approximately 200 million people [8]. With increasing sea level rise, adaptation solutions to combat it have become essential [7] one of them being floating structures! 

Floating architecture may serve as a solution due to its relatively low economic and logistical maintainability. These afloat settlements could provide safe, climate-resilient housing for flood-stricken communities. Do you think floating architecture could be the game changer in combating sea level rise?

Think of carbon removal as a pollution cleanup operation. For it to work, CO‚ÇÇ must be captured from the atmosphere and stored away safely and permanently without emitting more along the way [1]. 

There are lots of ways to do this: soil carbon sequestration; direct air capture; geological carbon storage; enhanced weathering and more [4,5,6,7].

But it‚Äôs really important to remember: we can‚Äôt let dreams of carbon sequestration delay emissions reduction today. 

Were there any carbon removal methods you were curious about and would like us to cover more deeply? Let us know in the comments! Bye!

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve known since the early 1900s that when we burn carbon-based materials, such as coal or oil, CO2 is released.‚Äù:
https://www.americanscientist.org/article/carbon-dioxide-and-the-climate 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve also known since the 1850s that CO2 is able to trap heat.‚Äù:
https://www.americanscientist.org/article/carbon-dioxide-and-the-climate

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been collecting data about what we burn since the 70s‚Äù:
https://www.eia.gov/about/legislative_timeline.php

‚Äúwe have actually been able to measure the parts per million of co2 for the last 800,000 years!‚Äù:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

‚ÄúWe know this from studying ancient ice cores‚Äù:
https://icecores.org/about-ice-cores

‚ÄúBy analyzing these tiny trapped bubbles of air and knowing how deep they were we can learn about the concentration of CO2 in the air at a given time in the past!‚Äú:
https://icecores.org/about-ice-cores 

‚ÄúBecause of these ice cores we can be pretty sure that the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today is higher than it has been in the past 800,000 years.‚Äù:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

‚Äú We also know that the rate at which the ppm of co2 is increasing is higher than past rates.‚Äù
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

‚ÄúToday, scientists across the globe have set up measuring towers and ocean buoys to record global temperatures 24/7. And guess what? These temperatures have been steadily rising.‚Äù:
https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ten-signs-global-warming 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen glaciers retreating, reduced snow cover, a decline in arctic sea ice, and a resulting rise in sea levels.‚Äù:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 

‚ÄúFrom these models, it's clear that the global changes we are seeing right now cannot be explained by natural phenomena.‚Äù:

48,jYjvJyEMHZ4,Science ABC,What are GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms)?,"GMO or genetically modified organisms are organisms with their DNA modified, usually by adding new or different DNA from another organism. GM crops are crops that have genes from bacteria. These genes allow the plants to either produce chemicals that can kill only insect pests, or be resistant to herbicide. Since the plants have DNA from another species, they are called transgenic crops. We grow GM crops on nearly 185 million hectares in 26 countries, including 19 developing countries. That‚Äôs roughly 12% of the global cropland. We regularly produce GM soybean, corn, cotton, alfalfa, canola, apples, papaya, potatoes, summer squash, sugar beets, and pineapple. So, what is the science behind these crops? How do we make such crops in the lab?

49,H-FyOpURPXI,Science ABC,Photoelectric Effect Explained in Simple Words for Beginners,"Photoelectric effect occurs when electromagnetic radiation above the threshold frequency of the given metallic surface, strikes the surface and releases electrons from it. This happens because light is made of massless particles called photons, which possess a certain amount of energy. When these photons strike the surface, they knock electrons off it; we call these photoelectron. 

Just because a light ray has a high intensity doesn't mean that it will cause the photoelectric effect. It can only happen if the frequency of the light rays is equal to or greater than a given value‚Äîknown as the threshold frequency‚Äîof the metal. In this video, we have explained the photoelectric effect, threshold frequency and the work function in simple words

51,KJU4vZMHegg,Science ABC,Bose Einstein Condensate Explained in Simple Words,"Bose Einstein condensate is considered the fifth state of matter - it‚Äôs obtained when gas particles are cooled to almost absolute zero temperature. To generate the Bose-Einstein condensate, the first step is to obtain a cloud of gas; a typical example is the gas of rubidium atoms. The next step is to use lasers to remove the atoms' energy and cool them down. An evaporative cooling method is utilized for further cooling until the atoms are close to absolute zero. At this stage, the atoms assume the same quantum states and operate as a single entity. If you were to measure their location at this point, you would observe a blurred ball, rather than individual atoms.

Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) have various practical uses in precision measurement and sensing technologies, which have led to advancements in detecting gravitational waves, creating navigation systems, and improving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, BECs have been used to develop atom lasers, which hold great potential for the precise manipulation of atomic matter. This advancement has already aided research in quantum optics and lithography.

53,BBwULYIOkfk,Science ABC,What is Blackbody Radiation: Explained in Simple Terms,"A black body is a theoretical or imaginary object that perfectly absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation, and also emits radiation, like heat and visible light, based on its temperature. A black body is considered theoretical because no object can be a perfect absorber of electromagnetic radiation. Think of it this way: when you heat an iron rod, it becomes extremely hot, and its color changes to dull red, followed by bright red, orange and then yellow. This is a good example of how black body radiation works. 

In this video, you will learn about blackbody radiation, the blackbody radiation curve and how it helps to understand electromagnetic radiation and celestial bodies.

While bullets travel incredibly fast and pack a concentrated force, the size and momentum of the bullet are too small to knock a person off their feet. Factors such as bullet weight and location on the body also play a role in the impact felt by the victim. However, the shooter is more likely to experience the backward force of recoil, which can be strong enough to knock them off their feet.

79,cW4kG9a5xA4,Science ABC,Singularity and Event Horizon: The Mysterious World of Black Holes,"Have you ever heard of a black hole? In the 1960s, the renowned physicists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose predicted that a star with an even denser mass would collapse into a point of infinite density, creating a singularity. At this point, the known laws of physics break down, and spacetime curvature becomes so severe that any light that falls into the pit is held captive forever. This is how a black hole is formed.

In this Youtube short, we will explore the fascinating world of black holes, from singularity to the event horizon. You‚Äôll discover how the singularity of a black hole distorts the spacetime around it, and how the event horizon marks the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole‚Äôs gravitational pull.

Join us on a journey to the heart of darkness as we explore the mysteries of black holes and the enigma of singularity and event horizon.

But, of course, this brain is not real. But how would such a brain know that its memories are artificial and its existence is more like a hallucination? How would we know that we aren‚Äôt those artificial brains? This is the Boltzmann Brain paradox, the result of Ludwig Boltzmann‚Äôs many years of debate with other scientists on his interpretation of entropy.

In this video, we discuss the Boltzmann brain in simple terms and understand why we humans are real and not Boltzmann brains!

85,jKYBZF5P1PM,Science ABC,What Have Sunflowers Got To Do With Nuclear Disasters?,"Sunflowers are the international symbol for nuclear disarmament. You will most likely find sunflowers around areas where nuclear disasters have occurred in the past. Following the 1986 meltdown at the Chernobyl Power Plant in Ukraine, which released over 100 radioactive elements into the environment, sunflowers were planted in droves to extract the radioactive isotopes from the fallout-impacted sites. This approach is based on the principle of phytoremediation, which employs the use of plants to cleanse the environment.

The Chernobyl sunflower project was born in 1994 when a New Jersey-based company planted sunflowers on a floating raft with the intention to absorb radioactive isotopes from the water. It was observed that the plants selectively absorbed radio-cesium (137Cs) and radio-strontium (90Sr) from the water, and results indicated that about 95% of the radio-nuclides had been cleared out in a span of only ten days. In this video, we explore this magical ability of sunflowers in more detail.

87,G9t__9Tmwv4,Science ABC,Climate Change and Global Warming: Explained in Simple Words for Beginners,"The term climate change is used to denote the long-term changes in the weather patterns in a given region. Another term often interchanged with climate change is global warming. Global warming is formally defined as a rise in Earth's temperature that persists for a decade or longer.
There could be several causes for climate change, but the biggest one is the rising concentration of greenhouse gases. Simply put, greenhouse gases are those gases in our atmosphere that trap heat. Some examples include carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and ozone.

Natural sources and human activities both result in the emission of greenhouse gases. One of the most common ways these gases get released into the atmosphere is through the burning of fossil fuels. Burning coal or oil to run industrial processes or giant factories increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Indeed, fossil fuels' contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is the largest, in the range of 70- 80% of total emissions.

In this video, we explain, in simple terms, climate change and global warming and what we can do as a community and individually to save Earth from climate change.

88,Tn3c6wgNjB8,Science ABC,Endocrine System: How Hormones Work?,"The endocrine system is composed of glands that produce hormones to affect changes in distant target organs. It is crucial in maintaining homeostasis‚Äîbalance‚Äîin the body. There are seven major endocrine glands scattered throughout the body: the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, the thyroid, the thymus, the pancreas, the adrenal glands and the gonads (testes or ovaries) (eight if you count the hypothalamus). All endocrine glands secrete their hormones into the bloodstream from there the hormones travel to the target organs.

89,FVUbIaD94Ao,Science ABC,Neutron Stars Explained in Simple Words for Laymen,"Neutron stars are formed from the core of some starrs. Neutron stars generally have a radius of only around 12 km. With masses exceeding 1.4 times that of the Sun, these are some of the densest objects in the Universe. A tablespoonful of neutron star material could weigh as much as Mount Everest. 
They are called neutron stars because they are composed almost entirely of neutrons. There are also trace amounts of an equal number of electrons and protons, given the whole object a net neutral charge.
Neutron stars also create one of the most powerful magnetic fields in the universe. Their magnetic fields can be as much as one million billion (or one quadrillion), times stronger than that of Earth. In fact, in 2004, a neutron star, located around 50,000 light-years away, underwent an outburst. Its magnetic field was so strong that it affected the Earth's ionosphere, even from that monumental distance!
We have discovered more than 2,500 neutron stars so far. Some well-known examples include the Crab Pulsar, located in the Crab Nebula, and the Vela Pulsar, found in the Vela Supernova Remnant.

90,ghbZytkg7rY,Science ABC,How Robert J. Oppenheimer became the ‚ÄòFather of the Atomic Bomb‚Äô,"Robert J. Oppenheimer, born on April 22, 1904, is known as the father of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer was awarded a PhD in theoretical physics and was interested in the emerging field of quantum physics. As a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, Oppenheimer was involved in the latest research in nuclear and quantum physics. In 1942, Oppenheimer became the Director of The Manhattan project, a project to develop a nuclear weapon that could be used against the Axis powers during work. His ambition, genius, and energy allowed him to lead one of the most ambitious projects modern physics had ever seen. 
After the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer saw the devastation that nuclear weapons could cause. A large part of his later years were spent trying to ensure that nuclear weapons would not be misused by any government of the world. Unfortunately, the Cold war era and fear of communism would turn the father of the nuclear bomb into a target for suspicion. 

Fun fact: Oppenheimer was often called Oppie by his students and fellow colleagues.

91,BiR1cPisge8,Science ABC,Higgs Boson (The God Particle) and Higgs Field Explained in Simple Words,"The Higgs boson is a wave, ripple or disturbance in an invisible, all-permeating field called the Higgs field. In the year 1964, Peter Higgs, Fran√ßois Englert and four other scientists proposed a rather unique idea to explain why certain particles had mass. They hypothesized that the entire universe is filled with an invisible, all-permeating field that gives mass to all elementary particles.

The field in question is called the Higgs field. A wave, ripple or disturbance in that field is therefore called the Higgs boson, or the Higgs particle.

This theory suggests that particles do not have a mass of their own; rather, they get their mass by interacting with the Higgs field. How heavy a particle is will be determined by how strongly a particle interacts with the Higgs field. Electrons, quarks and other elementary particles interact with the Higgs field in different ways and therefore have different masses. Photons, however, don‚Äôt interact with the field, and thus have no mass.

92,hxETN4EKJvA,Science ABC,Slowing or Reversing Aging: Can We Live for 180 years?,"Ageing is a complex process which results from progressive loss of the body‚Äôs ability to maintain itself. This ageing comes with diseases and a general decline in health. Over the past few decades, scientists have come to better understand how we age and are now imagining a future where you could live up to 100 and be fit as a fiddle. 

Although, reaching the unbelievable age of 180 might not be possible‚Ä¶ yet. A healthy 100 is far from uncommon, and perhaps we will push that to 130 years of healthy living, but we'll only find out when we, and our research, age a bit further.

93,W1Z2y38lvbU,Science ABC,Detectives Use this Simple Technique to Find Your Fingerprints (Even AFTER You Have Wiped Them Off)!,"There‚Äôs a common movie trope of an actor wiping their fingerprints off a gun. It seems like a simple wipe with a cloth eliminates any trace of a criminal‚Äôs guilt, but that isn‚Äôt actually the case!
Scientists have developed a method that can visualize prints from even the faintest fingerprint deposits left after the metal of a gun is wiped off. This technique uses a colored-electro active film that uses fingerprint residues as a stencil for blocking the electric current. Once a voltage is passed through, the oily regions deflect the colored substances surrounding bare regions, which gives rise to a negative ridge pattern.

As it turns out 360 is actually a very good number. From a purely mathematical standpoint, a number like 10 or 100 would have been more inconvenient.

You see, the number 360 is divisible by every number from 1 to 10, aside from 7. In addition to that, 360 has 24 divisors. This is the highest number of divisors for any positive whole number up to its own value of 360. This is just one of the reasons why a circle is 360 degrees. 

In this video, we have discussed some other reasons that make 360 an idea number for calculations.

This is the physics of our day-to-day lives‚Äîthe rolling of balls, the rotation of the earth, and the mechanics of engines. Quantum physics deals with particles that are incredibly small and hence, the laws of classical physics don‚Äôt apply in this world.

Due to this, less diesel is required to produce the same energy output as gasoline. Similarly,  diesel engines are bulky, and typically consist of longer piston strokes, so they can‚Äôt reach high RPMs without incurring a lot of mechanical strain. This causes a loss in the total power output, although diesel's benefit from the tremendous torque that is generally lacking in gasoline engines.

In this video, we compare a number of features of diesel and gasoline engines to look at which fuel is better, or in other words, is there really a better fuel?

98,Kkwp7Ap6N9A,Science ABC,Black Holes Explained: What Is a Black Hole? How They Form in Space?,"A black hole is a celestial body or simply a place in space where the gravitational pull is so high that nothing, not even light can escape it. This is why it's completely black, and hence it's called a black hole. A black hole's ‚Äúsurface,‚Äù called its event horizon, defines the boundary where the velocity needed to escape exceeds the speed of light.

When a massive star dies, it leaves a small but dense remnant core in its wake. If the mass of the core if more than around 3 times the mass of the sun, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and a black hole is formed.

A black hole is not just empty space; in fact, it‚Äôs a great deal of amount packed into a very small area. Think of a star which is 10 times more massive than our is squeezed into a sphere which has the diameter equal to the size of New York city. The result will be a celestial object whose gravitational field is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. This is why black holes are named so, because they are pitch black!


""Black holes explained"" is a short-animated video explaining the science of ‚Äòwhat is a black hole‚Äô and ‚Äòhow black holes are formed‚Äô? The ""black hole picture 2019"" is a recent event that occurred in April 2019, which involved the release of the first ever black hole picture to the general public. But what are black holes? How are black holes formed? What‚Äôs the explanation behind the black hole theory?

99,JaXMGFShqDE,Science ABC,Gut Microbiome Explained in Simple Words,"The gut microbiome are the trillions of microorganisms ‚Äì primarily bacteria, but also fungi, viruses and protists ‚Äì that live inside your digestive system. Scientists are discovering that these microbes are vital for us to live healthy lives. They help us digest food and provide us with nutrients, they can modulate our mood and help us sleep better, and they even help the immune system do their job better. 

Gut bacteria are those bacteria that live inside the digestive system of all animals, including humans. We‚Äôve found that these bacteria are crucial to our health, both physical and mental. They help us digest food, provide us with nutrients and help us fend of pathogenic bacteria.

Simply put ‚Äì gut bacteria, also known as the gut microbiota, are the bacteria present in our bodies lined across the inner walls of our gastrointestinal tract. There are about 300-500 bacterial species in the human gut with their average population being 100 trillion. That‚Äôs enough to fill twelve thousand, six hundred and fifty-eight Earths at our current population. Initially, that was thought to be ten times the number of human cells in our body but new research suggests the ratio of bacterial cells to human cells could be 1.3:1.

100,vIeRLeQq7V4,Science ABC,"Particle accelerators: What are they, how do they work and why are they important to us?","A particle accelerator is a machine that accelerates particles. More specifically, it accelerates elementary particles, like protons and electrons, at extremely high speeds‚Äîalmost 99.99% of the speed of light. These particles are then smashed against a stationary target or against other particles traveling in the opposite direction. These collisions produce massive particles, such as the top quark or the Higgs boson, which last for only a fraction of a second. Then, almost immediately, these particles convert into smaller, lighter particles, which, in turn, decay almost instantly. These collisions not only help us understand the composition of the elementary particles in question but also supplement our knowledge of our universe‚Äôs origin immediately following the Big Bang.

Particle accelerators can be broadly classified into two categories‚Äîlinear accelerators (also called LINACs) and circular accelerators. In this video, we discuss linear and circular accelerators and their respective applications.

Truth of Multiple Realities,"Multiverse theory suggests that our universe, which consists of billions and billions of planets, stars and galaxies and extends out tens of billions of light-years, may not be the only universe that exists. There could be another universe that is completely different from ours with its own natural laws. Even more maddeningly, there may not be just one, but an infinite number of such universes, all of which differ from one another and harbor millions of celestial bodies and even intelligent life forms, just as our universe does.

Multiverse theory assumes that our universe is only a small member of an enormous composition of a multitude of universes.

The idea of multiple universes is so astounding that it has been hypothesized not only in cosmology and astronomy, but also in philosophy, music, literature, science fiction, and even religion. Because of the universality of this idea, these ‚Äúother"" universes are called by different names, including parallel universes, alternative universes, parallel realities, quantum realities, alternative realities, and more.
In this video, we explain what exactly is the multiverse theory and what it means for humankind.

105,3khY_bwf5FY,Science ABC,What Exactly is Spacetime? Explained in Ridiculously Simple Words,"Spacetime, as a concept, is related to a space that consists of 4 dimensions instead of the regular 3-dimensional space. As early as 1905, Einstein proposed a now widely popular theory that the speed of light is independent of the motion of all observers, and that space and time are interconnected in a single continuum. This theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern and quantum physics, is known as Einstein‚Äôs special theory of relativity. Einstein's proposed idea of a single continuum where space and time are interwoven is what people call ‚Äúspace-time‚Äù.
According to this theory, time‚Äîwhich has traditionally been considered an independent entity according to the principles of classical physics‚Äîis affected when a body moves through space. This happens because, according to the theory, time and space are connected and part of a single continuum‚Äîspacetime.
In this video, we discuss spacetime in absolutely simple words: what exactly is spacetime and how is it related to the force of gravitation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity?

106,v48u8hjqNBU,Science ABC,"What Are The Different Atomic Models? Dalton, Rutherford, Bohr and Heisenberg Models Explained","Atomic Models: Centuries ago, people didn‚Äôt know exactly what was inside an atom, but they had some ‚Äúideas‚Äù. Around 400 BC, a Greek philosopher named Democritus came up with a theory that everything in the world was made of tiny indestructible particles called ‚Äúatomos‚Äù, which means ‚Äúuncuttable‚Äù. However, this theory was largely discredited by Aristotle‚Äîthe original social influencer, who believed that everything on this planet was made of four elements: earth, fire, water, and air. 
The next step in atomic theory development didn‚Äôt happen for nearly 2000 years, when British chemist John Dalton conducted some experiments. Following his breakthrough, Dalton proposed that everything in the world was made up of atoms‚Äîtiny indestructible solid spheres that were unique for every element. Atoms of different elements combine to form different compounds and are rearranged during chemical reactions. 
After that, came an English physicist named J.J Thompson and his trusty cathode ray tube. He proposed the famous ‚Äúplum pudding‚Äù model. This model characterizes an atom as a particle that is composed of a positively charged mass (the pudding), as well as tiny negative charges embedded in it (like plums). After this, another chemist called Rutherford proposed his model of an atom where most of the atom‚Äôs mass was concentrated in a positively charged center (which he later named the nucleus) around which the electrons orbited like planets around the sun. After Rutherford, another chemist Neils Bohr theorized that if an electron jumped to a lower energy orbit, it would give out the extra energy in the form of radiation, thereby maintaining atomic stability. Even though Bohr‚Äôs model doesn‚Äôt hold true for complex multi-electron systems, this model is still the most popular representation of atomic structure in most textbooks.

108,yYUImmcq-bc,Science ABC,Emotions and the Brain: What is the limbic system?,"The limbic system is the term for various parts of the brain involved in emotions such as fear, aggression, and attraction, and behaviors related to these emotions, as well as memory, learning, and senses. The four important parts of the limbic system are the amygdala, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus. 

The olfactory system and the thalamus.
For most senses such as touch and sight, sensory neurons make their first stop at the thalamus and then make their way to other parts of the brain. But, for the sense of smell, the olfactory neurons from the nose make their first stop at the olfactory bulb in the brain. There is some evidence (sources included in the references) that from the olfactory cortex, neurons make their way to the thalamus (the mediothamalic nuclei) for higher sensory processing.

109,8-t-1EkOhAE,Science ABC,Dark Matter Explained: What Exactly is Dark Matter? | A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Dark Matter,"Dark matter is an invisible matter that occupies more than half of the space of the observable universe but cannot be detected directly as it doesn‚Äôt interact with electromagnetic radiation, like visible light and gamma rays. One of the greatest challenges that astral scientists and researchers face before they can fully understand the universe is so-called ""dark matter."" Originally called the ‚Äòmissing matter‚Äô, dark matter is the name given to particles that don‚Äôt absorb or emit light, making them impossible to detect through observing electromagnetic radiation.

Think of it this way‚Äîhow do you see or observe something in your everyday life?
You are able to see things because visible light, a type of electromagnetic radiation, bounces off objects around you and then reaches your eyes. All celestial bodies interact with electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, radio waves, gamma rays, and the rest. More notably, they alter the way radiation travels around them, which is how we detect far-off galaxies hiding billions upon billions of miles away.
But dark matter cannot be observed this way, because it doesn‚Äôt interact with electromagnetic radiation. Check out this video to learn more about dark matter, how was it first discovered and how is it detected now.

110,KjIUzV094wE,Science ABC,What Exactly is a Tesseract? (Hint: Not a Superhero Stone),"A tesseract is a 4D cube, i.e. a cube that exists in 4 dimensions. Although fans of the Marvel universe and superheroes may associate tesseract with the glowing blue box that houses the Space stone, a tesseract is a real geometrical concept that exists in four dimensions. 

Here is a simple way to conceptualize dimensions: a square is a 2D shape, so each of its corners has 2 lines coming off it at 90 degrees to each other. A cube is three-dimensional, so each of its corners has 3 lines coming off it. Similarly, a tesseract is a 4D shape, so every corner has 4 lines coming off it.
Mathematically speaking, a tesseract is a perfectly accurate and plausible shape, as are all shapes in higher dimensions, such as 5D and 6D. Just as a cube can be unfolded into 6 squares in 2D space, a tesseract can be unfolded into 8 cubes in 3D space.

In the lungs are alveoli that are connected to the capillaries. At the alveoli gaseous exchange takes place - oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves into the alveoli to be then expelled.

112,2tv6Ej6JVho,Science ABC,What is the Fibonacci Sequence & the Golden Ratio? Simple Explanation and Examples in Everyday Life,"The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which a given number is the addition of the two numbers before it. So, if you start with 0, the next number will be 1, followed by 1, followed by 2, followed by 3 and so on. As you can see, every number in this series or sequence is obtained by adding the two preceding numbers. This simple series of numbers is referred to as the Fibonacci sequence for Fibonacci series. And individual numbers in this sequence are often called Fibonacci numbers.

To the uninitiated, it may just seem like a series of numbers, but the Fibonacci sequence has been discovered and rediscovered in various forms, not only in mathematics, but also in nature and our everyday lives. 

There‚Äôs another exciting offshoot of the Fibonacci sequence - the golden ratio. Seashells are one of the most common examples of the golden spiral in nature. Ocean waves, hurricanes, flower buds, snail shells, spider webs are some of the many naturally-occurring examples.

The digestive system is composed of the long continuous alimentary tract or gastrointestinal tract (or simply gut) and accessory organs like the pancreas, liver, gallbladder. Our digestive system also receives help from gut bacteria that reside in the intestines.
But that's just the surface of the digestive system. New research shows that our guts affect our body in surprising ways. Our gut communicates with the nervous system and might affect our moods and mental health. The gut bacteria help the immune system fight of deadly pathogens! Our digestive tract is more complex than first appears.

114,M0uw4ZNpqcI,Science ABC,What is Radioactivity and Is It Always Harmful: Explained in Really Simple Words,"Radioactivity is the property through which a heavier, unstable nucleus assumes a more stable state by emitting radiation. The process through which a nucleus turns into a stable one is called radioactive decay. But is radioactivity or radioactive radiation always harmful? Let‚Äôs discuss this in more detail.
Inside an atom‚Äôs nucleus, there are positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. These nucleons are held together by a ‚Äúglue‚Äù called the strong nuclear force. This strong force cancels out the repulsive electrostatic force of like charged protons and keeps the nucleus stable. The nuclear force has a short range of action and is dependent on the ratio of neutrons and protons present in a nucleus. However, we see that the balance between the forces starts to waver in a nucleus where the number of neutrons exceeds the number of protons. A nucleus that exceeds the threshold number of neutrons and protons that the strong nuclear force can hold together comfortably will be more unstable.
More specifically, these scenarios give rise to unstable isotopes of elements. Just as your body, through a series of expansions and contractions, expels a substance with a sneeze, similarly, the unstable isotopes of elements fling out different particles or forms of energy to restore balance between the forces in their nucleus. During this process of attaining stability, they change into a new nucleus. It is exactly this property, namely turning into something new to attain stability, that we call radioactivity.

The rungs of the ladder are made of four different chemicals that pair with each other - A with T, C with G. The sequence of these chemicals is how the information is stored in DNA. Certain proteins read this ""code"" (ATCGCG) to create proteins. These proteins go on to form cells, cells form tissues which go on to form organs and all the organs come together to form a living being.

116,MKbF-MvRjEU,Science ABC,Grandfather Paradox: Explained in Simple Words,"The grandfather paradox is considered the biggest, most popular objection to the logical possibility of backwards time travel. It characterizes a hypothetical situation in which a time traveller goes to their past and ends up causing an event (like, the killing of their grandfather) which makes travelling to the past and altering it impossible.
What this means is that if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, you don‚Äôt exist, which means that your grandfather cannot be killed. As you can see, there are two realities occurring in parallel here. The grandfather paradox is also a key plot element in the famous Hollywood movie Tenet (released in 2020), directed by Christopher Nolan.
Although all this talk about time travel and the grandfather paradox is obviously purely hypothetical, there is evidence of two realities occurring in parallel at the same time. This is a phenomenon in the quantum world which is known as superposition.

118,2KMAv880v6s,Science ABC,Gravitational Lensing: What It Is And How It Is Helping Us Discover New Galaxies,"Gravitational lensing occurs when a huge amount of matter, like a star, galaxy, or cluster of galaxies, creates a powerful gravitational field around it, strong enough to bend the light coming from distant galaxies (behind them). Roots of gravitational lensing lie in Einstein theory of relativity which states that massive bodies warp the space around it. Thereby the light passing through this warped space curves near massive celestial bodies. Depending upon the position of emitting, lensing and observing body, gravitational lensing may distort, magnify or lead to multiple occurrences of the same object in different places. 

Leveraging the concept of gravitational lensing, a technique called microlensing is developed which is helping us in discovering new galaxies and dark matter. Einstein ring is a beautiful phenomena observed using microlensing which we have illustrated in this video using animations. Thus, Einstein's ground-breaking work on general relativity in 1915 has paved the way for astronomers to continue studying the very structure of the Universe leveraging the power of gravity!

119,wChr0hCga5g,Science ABC,Archimedes Principle: Explained in Really Simple Words,"Archimedes principle states that if an object is submerged in a fluid, then the buoyant force acting on it is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by that object. Buoyant force exists because pressure increases as an object goes deeper in a fluid, which, in this case, is water. Due to this, the force from the pressure exerted in the downward direction on the top of the object is LESS than the force from pressure exerted in the upward direction on the bottom of the object. 
When Archmiedes got into the bathtub, he realized that as more of his body was submerged in water, the more water spilled over the bathtub‚Äôs edge. He realized that there must be a clear relationship between his weight and the weight of the water displaced by his submerged body. This was a groundbreaking idea, and one that could be applied to solve the problem of determining the purity of gold in Hieron‚Äôs crown.

121,m7gXgHgQGhw,Science ABC,What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Explained in Simple Words,"Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle says that if we know everything about where a particle is located, we know nothing about its momentum. Conversely, if we know everything about its momentum, then we know nothing about where the particle is located. In other words, this principle means that we cannot measure the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision or certainty. 
But waves, as you know, don‚Äôt exist in one specific place. However, you can certainly identify and measure specific characteristics of a wave pattern as a whole, most notably, its wavelength, which is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs. Particles that are as small or even smaller than atoms have large enough wavelengths to be detected, and can therefore be measured in experiments. 
Thus, if we have a wave whose wavelength and momentum can be measured accurately, then it‚Äôs impossible to measure its specific position. Conversely, if we know the position of a particle with high certainty, then we cannot accurately determine its momentum. This is what Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle is all about.

122,Rq9Wd3RiNrc,Science ABC,Why Are Planetary Orbits Elliptical?,"Planetary orbits are elliptical because gravitational interaction over time changes the delicate balance of mass, velocity and distance from the star which otherwise keeps planetary orbit circular.
For a very long time, from Ptolemy to the age of Copernicus, it was widely believed and accepted that planets in our Solar System revolved in a perfectly circular path. Because the circle was presumed to be an ideal shape for planetary bodies to orbit. But then in the seventeenth century in his seminal book Astronomia Nova, Johannes Kepler rebutted this very idea. He put forth his own theory pertaining to planetary motion. He theorized that planetary bodies orbit in an elliptical path with the Sun sitting at one of the foci of that ellipse. In this video we will try to understand what makes these planetary orbits elliptical.

123,TlSOMfDX-yY,Science ABC,Why Are There Stones Along Railway Tracks?,"The crushed stones that line railroad tracks are collectively called track ballast. More specifically, the track ballast constitutes the trackbed upon which sleepers or railroad ties are laid. As you may have seen, these stones are packed below, between and around the railroad ties. The thickness of the track ballast usually ranges between 25-30 cm, and varies depending on certain conditions pertaining to the geographical location of the railway track.

Track ballast usually consists of crushed rocks or stone, but in some cases, less suitable alternatives, like burnt clay, are also used. However, it‚Äôs important to understand that you can‚Äôt just throw a bunch of rocks on a railroad and be done with it. As mentioned, the stones in the track ballast have a characteristic shape, size and texture. Their surface is not smooth and their edges are jagged, and for good reason. These rocks interlock with each other and therefore stay in place. If you replace them with circular or smooth rocks, they would slide over each other and compromise the strength of the track ballast. As you might imagine, this can have catastrophic results.

125,fkAAbXPEAtU,Science ABC,Quantum Entanglement: Explained in REALLY SIMPLE Words,"Quantum entanglement is a physical resource, like energy, that is possible between quantum systems. When a coin spins on a flat surface, it‚Äôs in a state of superposition between its two faces‚Äîhead and tails. Similarly, electrons in their natural state exist as a superposition of both up and down spin. Only when measured do they give a definite value of up or down, which, in technical terms, is referred to as the ‚Äúcollapse of the wavefunction‚Äù.

In quantum mechanics, wave function collapse occurs when a wave function, which was initially in a superposition of a few states, reduces to a single state due to interaction with the external world.

When a pair of electrons are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity, their spin states can get entangled, which is what scientists call the quantum entanglement of electrons.


Quantum entanglement was first recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Roson and Schrodinger. In this video, we explain quantum entanglement in simple terms so that it becomes accessible to laymen and children who are interested to know about quantum entanglement

Lightning is one of the incredible forces of nature. A single bolt of it carries a few billion joules of energy, sufficient enough to power a tens of homes for a day. Humanity since the time of Franklin and Maxwell has been contemplating the idea of capturing lightning in a bottle but thus far we have got very little success. Volatile nature, sporadic appearance and uneven geographical distribution have made it very difficult to tap this nature's source of energy. Then our electrical systems aren't advanced enough to handle this sudden burst of electricity.  Although projects like Project First Light are ongoing with a mission to harvest energy from lightning, it is still under nascent stage. Perhaps it would take years before we could start using lightning as a renewable source of energy.

But, is that even possible? Science says, not really. When the insect's exoskeleton expands it gets too heavy and it doesn't expand enough for all the muscles of the insect to attach to it. There also isn't enough oxygen for insects to get large; 300 million years ago there was more oxygen and insects were as large as hawks. But, when birds and bats evolved, they began competing with and preying on large insects which led to the small insects we have today.

128,FaeFaiveb_Q,Science ABC,"What are Glial Cells: Definition, Types, Functions of Glial Cells | Role in Psychology","Glial cells are various types of brain cells. There are 3 main types of glial cells - astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells. These cells protect neurons, help neurons pass information, and keep the brain healthy.

These group of cells were relegated to a footnote in neurobiological history but in the last two decades, neuroscience has found that these cells not only take out the brain's garbage and maintain it, they might also be a crucial component to deciphering our thoughts and consciousness!

129,asTtd2nEd_A,Science ABC,Why Don't They Have Parachutes For Passengers In Commercial Planes?,"Commercial airplanes don't give parachutes to passengers. While airplanes have plenty of safety features that help in landing them safely during emergencies, having parachutes onboard for every passenger doesn't seem like a bad idea, does it? Although it may not seem so, but there are several good reasons why they don't hand out parachutes to passengers as they board a commercial airplane.

Firstly, a commercial plane flies way too high. At that altitude, any skydive would be riddled with countless risks. The temperature at that height is many degrees below the freezing point. Furthermore, the oxygen levels are so low that any skydiver would need a good enough portable oxygen supply. There are many important reasons, all of which are discussed in this video.

In this video, we‚Äôll take a look at some common movie myths that don‚Äôt hold up in real life.

Chloroform - movies love this chemical. But the way chloroform use is portrayed in movies is far from technically accurate. Guns! Another object that movies can‚Äôt get enough of. But there are so many firearms-related mistakes. How about the human brain? Do we use only 10 percent of it? Only 33 percent maybe? 

Talk about sci-fi movies set in space - they usually have spacecraft running and darting around celestial objects. Is that an accurate depiction of how celestial bodies exist in space?

131,u9D-7ZdV89w,Science ABC,Why Venus and Mercury have no Moons?,"Mercury and Venus have no moons because of their close proximity to the Sun. Any moon orbiting around them is likely be swallowed by the mammoth gravitational pull of the mighty Sun.
All planets except for Mercury and Venus have moons. In fact, Earth is the only planet to have just one moon; remaining planets from Mars onward have multiple moons, with Saturn having as much as 82 moons! So when most of the planets are inundated moons, why do Venus and Mercury have no moons?

The moonlessness of Venus and Mercury is mostly attributed to their proximity to the sun. Being so close to the sun means that they‚Äôre not only exposed to a lot of hostile solar radiation, but also experience the intense gravitational pull of the massive star nearby. For Mercury, the planet is simply too close to the Sun and also too small to have any sustainable gravitational influence to secure a moon in orbit. As for Venus, its slow retrograde rotation makes it challenging for any moon to stay in its orbit.

132,m0yu4y-y7kI,Science ABC,What Does It Take To Make Vaccines?,"Since vaccination was discovered in 1769 by Edward Jenner, it has come to become an indispensable part of healthcare. Over the last 50 years, advances in science and technology have allowed us to develop vaccines to  diseases at breakneck speed, but the process is still long and each disease and pathogen pose its own unique challenges.

On average, developing a vaccine for a completely new disease can take 8 years or more. Performing basic research to understand the pathogen, choosing the right vaccine strategy and then performing clinical trials all while ensuring the vaccine is safe and works well is a lengthy process.
For diseases such as the flu, past research has now made it possible for vaccine developers to design a new vaccine for a flu in a year‚Äôs time. There is similar hope that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be ready within a year due to the research already conducted in the past on other coronaviruses.

A note on clinical trials:

The structure of a clinical trial isn‚Äôt set in stone. Depending on various factors such as whether a vaccine is a new formulation or whether it is completely new, or for what disease the vaccine treats, the finer details of the clinical trials might vary. Every clinical trial might not be a double blind trial, although that is the gold standard. Additionally, phase I and phase II might not have a placebo in some instances.

133,7NDtaxq94sM,Science ABC,Are Zebras Black with White Stripes or White with Black Stripes?,"Zebras are actually black with white stripes. All animals get their colors from pigments called melanin which are of two kinds - eumelanin gives a black to brown color which pheomelanin gives reddish to yellow hues. The cells that create this pigment, melanocytes have certain genes that control when the pigment is made. Once the pigment is made, it is shipped to the skin or hair to give the latter color. 

When scientists looked at zebra embryos developing, they found that all melanocytes had pigment creating genes were turned on. These genes were selectively turned off in areas designated to be white stripes!
Underneath the black and white fur, a zebra‚Äôs skin is black. Melanocytes that give pigment to hair that differently controlled that melanocytes that give pigment to skin.

Although asteroids are present throughout the solar system, most of them live in the asteroid belt‚Äîa region located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The size of objects within the asteroid belt have a wide range, from being no bigger than a dust particle to almost a thousand kilometers wide. Our solar system came into existence about 4.6 billion years ago when a large cloud of gas and dust collapsed. 

Following this event, most of that material fell to the center of the cloud and resulted in the formation of the sun‚Äîthe central star of our solar system. Planets were formed from some of the condensing dust in that cloud, but not all celestial material had the chance to be incorporated into planets. The leftovers from that time took the form of asteroids.

135,dfsbspNlI14,Science ABC,Kindchenschema: Why Do We Find Babies Cute?,"Babies are cute because of their face structure and their sounds. Adult brains find the faces features of babies' faces cute. This signature cute baby face is called Kindchenschema (or baby scheme in English). Our brains seemed to be hardwired to find baby features cute and this is probably related to survival. We are compelled by the power of the baby‚Äôs cuteness to care and nurture for it. This works out great when you consider that many mammal‚Äôs baby‚Äôs take many months and years to be able to fend for themselves. 
This power of cuteness isn‚Äôt limited to survival. The spillover effects are that cuteness and taking care of a baby might make us more empathetic and there is even research to show that looking at cute things, even cute fictional characters might boost our concentration.

So, there you go! Look at a few cute kittens and then get back to work.

A note on Konrad Lorenz:

Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist and widely considered the father of animal behaviour studies. He‚Äôs famous for his duck imprinting experiments among others. But, he has some shady facets to his life. During the 1940s, Lorenz applied for application to the Nazi party and even contributed. Later in his life though, he is recorded to have regretted his involvement with the party and his work for them, expressing that he didn‚Äôt really know the extent of the atrocities. Many science historians have wondered to what extent his work was influenced by his affiliations with the party and its Nationalist Socialist ideology.

136,Yj240oulsc8,Science ABC,Coriolis Effect: How Hurricanes Form & Why they Spin in different ways in North and South Hemisphere,"Hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are formed due to violent storms that originate over oceans and seas and move towards land, potentially causing extensive damage to both life and property. But there is a very interesting thing related to hurricanes - they spin counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere but clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Why does that happen? 


You may already know that hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are different names for the same natural phenomenon‚Äîa tropical cyclone. In essence, they‚Äôre all very violent storms that originate over oceans and seas and move towards land. They are caused by pre-existing weather disturbances, moist and warm air, warm tropical oceans and relatively light winds. 



In the southern hemisphere, winds traveling towards the equator are diverted towards the east. Similarly, in the northern hemisphere, winds traveling towards the equator are diverted towards east, because earth rotates from west to east. This causes hurricanes to spin in different directions in both hemispheres.



In this video, we explain hurricanes, why and how they form and why they spin in different directions in different hemispheres.

Why Does Everyone Float In This Sea?","Lying on the lowest point on the Earth, the hypersaline Dead Sea is one of the most fascinating places on this planet. People float effortlessly here and that is the major attraction of the Dead Sea. But besides this natural buoyancy, unique environmental characteristics, abundance of salt and minerals, and the conspicuous absence of natural flora and fauna have piqued the interest of researchers and science enthusiasts for decades. With a salinity above 342g/kg, it makes it very difficult for usual marine life to thrive in this water. That's why it is called the 'Dead' sea.

The most riveting part about the Dead Sea is that you can keep floating in the Dead Sea automatically even if you don't know swimming! High salinity makes Dead Sea water denser than a human body. Thus, people naturally float in the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea also feels very different than other water bodies. It feels greasy and oily. Moreover, you cannot really ‚Äòswim‚Äô or ‚Äòdive‚Äô in the dead sea on account of its dense saline water. You simply stay afloat and enjoy the surreal feel!

138,rUogIRH2XwQ,Science ABC,How to live without a heart or a brain - Lessons from a Jellyfish,"The jellyfish is one weird sea animal. What makes it even weirder is that it doesn‚Äôt have a brain or a heart. Though it doesn‚Äôt have a brain, it does have a nervous system in the form of nerve nets and some have a structure called a nerve ring. This allows the jellyfish to reflexively respond to its surroundings. Some jellyfish like box jellyfish even have structures similar to a human eye that can see in 3-D images located inside the edge of their bell. 

The jellyfish also don‚Äôt have a heart and neither do they need it. In animals with a heart, the heart functions to distribute oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. For the jellyfish, oxygen simply diffuses from the water into their cells. Similarly with food, the jellyfish has a rudimentary stomach, called the gastroventricular cavity where food is digested and nutrients are directly absorbed into the jellyfish. 

*Nature or evolution aren‚Äôt conscious decision makers, designing life as they see fit. Evolution is a phenomenon where random genetic mutations create changes in traits over many generations.

140,mR0UhUnSUmo,Science ABC,What are fossils? Do bones decompose? How long does it take for bones to decompose?,"Ever wonder why bones can survive hundreds of years without decomposing? This is due to the unique composition of bone. Bone is primarily composed of a very stable protein called collagen and the mineral calcium. The association between collagen and calcium makes bone very sturdy. Many microbes and insects that feed on dead matter find it difficult to digest bone. But, over many months and even years, bones eventually decompose. But, certain environmental conditions preserve bones. Dry, arid conditions as well as acidic soil are great preservers of organic matter. 
The dinosaur bones that survive millions of years, aren‚Äôt really bones anymore. They are stones - fossils! Overtime, all the organic matter got decomposed and minerals from the water and soil around the bone deposited on the bone creating a stone replica of the bone that once was!

141,sTUYvQl6_bs,Science ABC,Here's Why You Should NEVER Mix Bleach and Ammonia,"Ammonia and bleach are very popular for cleaning surfaces. However, the fact that you should NEVER mix ammonia and bleach is so well-known because their combination may lead to the formation of dangerous, potentially hazardous byproducts as a result of certain chemical reactions that occur between the two compounds, Since sodium hypochlorite is the active ingredient in chlorine-based bleach, it may first decompose to form hydrochloric acid, which can then lead to the formation of chloramine vapors. Exposure to these toxic gases can trigger symptoms like irritation to the eyes and nose and coughing and shortness of breath. So, never mix ammonia and bleach!

142,zNmbD8fSt88,Science ABC,Why Don't We Have Pet Foxes?,"Both foxes and dogs belong to the same family Canidae. Then why haven‚Äôt foxes become our companions too?

To answer this, in 1950, a group of Russian scientists began an experiment to try and create the first ever pet fox species. The study led by Russian geneticist Dmitry K. Belyaev started out to understand how animals are domesticated.

There is some evidence that early humans did try to tame the fox. But foxes are very shy and chaotic animals. In comparison, the wolf might have been easier to domesticate. This might be one reason that they weren‚Äôt domesticated.  

The Russian fox farm experiment showed that it is possible to tame the fox. They are now investigating which genes might make some animals like the dogs friendly towards humans but others like foxes aggressive.

143,n7tnHPDH5d8,Science ABC,Lunar and Solar Eclipse Explained: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Eclipses,"Solar and lunar eclipses are celestial phenomena that occur when the sun, moon and Earth align in a way that either the moon casts a shadow on Earth or the latter casts a shadow on the moon. So what are the similarities and differences between lunar and solar eclipse? 

Just as Earth moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit every year, our natural satellite‚Äîthe moon‚Äîalso revolves around the Earth. It takes about 27.322 days for the moon to complete one revolution around our planet. Due to all the inter-related motion happening between these three celestial bodies, several physical phenomena occur. When the new moon, during its revolution around the Earth, moves between the sun and the Earth, it blocks out the sun‚Äôs rays, which casts a shadow on parts of the planet. This is called an eclipse of the sun or a solar eclipse. In other words, a solar eclipse happens when the moon passes in a direct line between the sun and the Earth. 

Since the moon continuously revolves around the Earth, it‚Äôs only natural that it sometimes comes between the sun and the Earth, while at other times it goes BEHIND the Earth, so that the Earth comes between the moon and the sun. When the latter happens, we see a lunar eclipse.

There is plenty of oxygen on Earth; but things change drastically as you breach the ‚Äòboundary‚Äô of the sky and reach the blackness of space. Oxygen is hard to come by in space, that‚Äôs why space engineers figured out a way to provide sufficient quantities of oxygen to astronauts that head to space and stay up there for months on end. Aboard the ISS, there are two systems that provide breathable oxygen to astronauts - NASA‚Äôs ECLSS and Russia‚Äôs Elektron. These two are referred to as oxygen generators, as they provide breathable oxygen through electrolysis of water. 


Check out this video for more details about ways through which astronauts get oxygen in space.

145,gBUjzm6w7Hs,Science ABC,Photosynthesis: The Biochemistry Behind How Plants Make Their Food,"Plants, unlike most living things, produce their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis means 'making using light'. Plants use the energy from the sunlight to make food. The food matter comes from carbon dioxide present in the air. These processes take place in a special compartment of a plant cell called the chloroplast.
Photosynthesis takes place in two steps, that can happen simultaneously in a plant cell. The first is light-dependent reactions which take place in structures called thylakoid present inside the chloroplast. In these reactions, pigments such as chlorophyll absorb light. Through a series of enzymatic reactions, the plant produces ATP, its energy currency and NADPH, a reducing molecule required to build the food. 
The second step is light-independent reactions. Here, the carbon dioxide taken into the cell is converted into food such as sugars which can further be converted into proteins, fats, or nucleic acids. Plants perform these reactions in the stroma of the chloroplast. 
The process of photosynthesis powers life. It converts a molecule that isn't food, carbon dioxide, into something we can derive energy from, sugars. In the process, oxygen is given out creating a favorable environment for us to live in. This is a feat of engineering humans could only dream of designing.

146,YJBhWVDArLo,Science ABC,How Does A Helicopter Work: Everything You Need To Know About Helicopters,"A helicopter works on the principle of aerodynamic lift - an upwards force that opposes the weight of the helicopter and holds it the air. So how exactly do the rotors of helicopters help them fly?

For any object to fly in the air, it must have the force of lift pushing it upwards, but for that to happen, the air must pass around an airfoil. In the case of a chopper, the airfoil is its main rotor wings. The blades of a chopper are uniquely designed so that they can generate lift; more specifically, they are curved on top and flatter at the bottom. 

This curved shape makes air flow faster over the top, which causes the air pressure on top of the blades to decrease. These wings rotate at a very high speed which causes air to pass over them in such a way that lift is generated due to Bernoulli‚Äôs principle. 

Helicopters steer in a given direction by generating more lift on one side than the other. Basically, when they need to go left, they generate more lift on the right and vice versa.

Some choppers can even fly upside down! An inverted chopper can use its blades to generate lift towards the bottom of the chopper the same way it normally uses them to generate lift upwards.

This video explains everything you need to know about helicopters.

147,intBEYKlaGY,Science ABC,"Rigor Mortis, Livor Mortis, Pallor Mortis, Algor Mortis: Forensic Science Explains Stages of Death","Once a person dies, their body begins a process of decay. This process can be seen through certain external changes which are called post mortem signs of death. There are 4 postmortem signs of death - pallor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and livor mortis in this order respectively. All these changes occur in the first 24-48 hours after death.
Pallor mortis is the first sign. It is when the skin becomes pale because of lack of blood flow to the skin.
Algor mortis is the second sign. It is the change in body temperature post mortem to reach external temperatures.
Rigor mortis is the 3rd stage. In this stage all the muscles stiffen because of cellular degradation called autolysis. It is preceded by primary flaccidity where all the muscles relax because the brain does not send the muscles signals to contract. As cellular degradation continues, it sets the onset of a second phase of relaxation called secondary flaccidity. This whole cycle can take for 24 hours.
Lastly, livor mortis is the pooling of blood due to gravity that appears as a purple colouration.
All these signs are used by forensic experts to determine time of death.

148,-7oVWSPBJY8,Science ABC,Why Is Space Cold If There Are So Many Stars?,"Space is filled with countless stars, all of which radiate enormous amounts of heat. These stars are tens of thousands of times bigger than our own sun. Still, space is considered to be cold. Why is that? If there are so many hot burning stars in space, why is space so cold?
From a purely technical standpoint, it‚Äôs not fair to say that space is cold in itself. Because technically, space is just a vacuum, and vacuum doesn't have a temperature of its own. It‚Äôs the objects in space that become cold in due time because they continuously lose heat due to radiation.
In addition to that, it‚Äôs not like all these stars are clumped up together. These stars are extremely hot, sure, but they are so far apart and have so much space between them that it‚Äôs simply impossible for them to heat up space. It is totally different from what you see when you look up at the night sky. In a nutshell, space is cold, despite having so many stars, because
space contains such an incomprehensibly large amount of
nothingness.

149,bugvN7sHN6E,Science ABC,Tensor Tympani Muscle: Why Do You Hear A Rumbling Sound When You Close Your Eyes Too Hard?,"The tensor tympani muscle is a tiny muscle in the middle ear that helps dampens external sounds falling on the ear. The tensor tympani muscle originates from the Eustachian tube, which is also known as the auditory tube. From there, this muscle attaches to the malleus bone‚Äîone of the three tiny bones located within the middle ear. This malleus bone looks like a little hammer, and the tensor tympani muscle attaches to the handle of this hammer. 

Tensor Tympani muscle is the reason behind that rumbling sound some people hear between their ears when they shut their eyes really tightly. It is the sound of the tensor tympani muscle stretching. This muscle is also responsible for dampening the sound of our own chewing.

Although the tensor tympani muscle is good at dampening loud, gradual sounds, but it is not so effective in softening up loud, sudden noises, like a gunshot or an explosion. This muscle activates involuntarily, but some people can hear its rumbling sound between their ears by squinting hard.

150,fqnmUNzn5N8,Science ABC,Hawking Radiation Explained: What Exactly Was Stephen Hawking Famous For?,"Hawking radiation was first discovered by English scientist Stephen Hawking in 1974. Prior to this discovery, our knowledge of black holes was very limited. It was believed that black holes were completely black and that they did not emit any kind of radiation. Astronomers had a very basic understanding of black holes; they believed that black holes radiate no energy of any sort. 

But thanks to Stephen Hawking‚Äôs discovery of the Hawking radiation, it was learned that black holes were not really black and could, in fact, emit radiation! His theory claimed that the mass of a black hole can become energy, and then that energy can be radiated away. 

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, for every particle throughout the universe, there exists an antiparticle. These particles always exist in pairs and keep popping in and out of existence everywhere in the universe. So when a particle and antiparticle pair pop in existence near the event horizon of a black hole, things become very interesting. The antiparticle gets sucked into the black hole while the particle is radiated away.

Learn more about the Hawking radiation and black holes in this short animated video.

151,y_cWTWB-N_I,Science ABC,Current Vs Voltage: How Much Current Can Kill You?,"Voltage vs current, or sometimes it's current vs voltage; we are constantly trying to understand the differences between these two entities related to electricity. Then, there is sometimes one more entity: resistance. How do these three entities, i.e. current, voltage and resistance play together to cause electric shocks? And more importantly, how much current or voltage can be lethal to you?
It‚Äôs very important to understand that it‚Äôs not only the current that is fatal to you. Current won‚Äôt flow in an electric circuit if there is no potential difference between two points. Also, the current has to flow for a long duration at a specific frequency for it to be lethal to humans. The point of contact of the electric shock also plays a key role in determining if the electric shock is fatal. Similarly, the state of the skin (wet skin or dry skin) plays a crucial role as well.
There‚Äôs a lot of confusion between current and voltage when it comes to which is lethal, or which is the more harmful one. You may have also heard the saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the volts that kill you, it‚Äôs the amps‚Äù - what does the phrase really mean? Find out in this video!

When a bird or a flock of birds hits an airplane, the plane may sustain some serious damage which can have disastrous consequences. 

Bird strikes are one of the biggest challenges that face the aviation industry today. They are a threat to all kinds of flying machines, be it a commercial jet, a military fighter aircraft or even a small private jet. But how exactly do bird strikes threaten aircraft safety? What happens when a bird runs into a flying airplane?

What can be done to minimize the number of or even prevent events of bird strikes?

Can anything travel faster than the speed of light? Is it even possible for something to undertake the ‚Äúspeed of light‚Äù travel? And what if something can actually travel faster than light? 

These are some of the most popular questions related to the speed of light and the plausibility of a light-speed travel. Well, as of now, it‚Äôs not possible for humans to travel at the speed of light. 

You may have heard people saying that nothing travels faster than the speed of light. Well, that statement is not entirely correct, unless the medium of light‚Äôs travel is specified too. It‚Äôs true that light travels the fastest, but that‚Äôs true only when it travels through a vacuum. Because in other mediums, like water, there are things that can travel faster than the speed of light. This is what Cherenkov radiation is all about. 

Cherenkov radiation is observed when something travels faster than the speed of light in a given medium. It‚Äôs a bluish glow that you can see in the water of nuclear reactors. Just like you hear a sonic boom when something travels faster than the speed of sound, Cherenkov radiation is observed when something travels faster than the speed of light.

159,gOWt_Hq3yrE,Science ABC,What is Entropy and Why is it Predicted to Cause the Heat Death of the Universe?,"Heat death of the universe, also called The Big Chill or Big Freeze, will happen when the entropy of the universe will be so high that everything and everyone that lives in it will perish. This will happen because an organism living in the universe wouldn't be able to extract order from its surroundings, because the latter would be more disordered than the organism itself. 


The death of the universe can occur in more ways than one, and this is one of the ways that some researchers and space scientists theorize that could be the reason behind the end of the entire universe.

Everything that has a beginning must also have an end. While we know the Universe sprung to life 13 billion years ago, we don't know when its illustrious journey will come to an end. What we do know is one of the ways it could happen. We call this plausible ultimate fate of the Universe Heat Death, and entropy is the culprit.

According to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy in the Universe can only increase, and it is this increase that will eventually cause its demise. Entropy is also why we cannot generate infinite energy. But what is entropy? And why should it only increase? How does it prevent us from generating infinite energy? And most importantly, why should its increase lead to the apocalypse? 


In this short animated video for kids, we explain the concept of entropy in simple, basic language.

In this short and simple video, we discuss the science of how rockets work. It is a short animated video for kids and laymen to understand the basics of a rocket launch. 

Rocket science is considered a highly technical, or even scary subject by many. But in reality, it‚Äôs not that complicated. Rocket launches are elaborate processes, which consist of a number of small, basic steps that need to be accomplished properly in order to reach the desired end result - the successful launch of the rocket.

A rocket is, in simple terms, a vehicle that is powered by rocket engines. NASA and other space agencies all over the world, including ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization), JAXA (Japanese Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russian Space Agency), ESA (European Space Agency) and CNSA have been involved in sending rockets into space for decades now. A rocket consists of three main parts - the guidance system, payload system and propulsion system. We discuss these systems in more detail in this short, simple video designed for kids.

This video has an immune system animation. The innate immune system consists of defenses against infection that are activated instantly as a pathogen attacks. Adaptive immunity (or acquired immunity) is a subsystem of the immune system that contains highly specialised systemic cells and processes that kill pathogens and prevent their growth in the body. Innate vs adaptive immunity: it‚Äôs important to realize that innate and adaptive immunity are different. Their differences are explained in the video in layman terms.

Our immune system is a fascinating entity, that functions in quite a unique and efficient manner. Comprising of various types of cells, it is prepared for any kind of breach in the fortress of our body, and is equipped to fight off a staggering number of intruders.
In this video, we give you a brief overview of the immune system, and the basic types of cells involved, along with the function they carry out.

Each cell if the immune system carries out various roles, depending on the kind of threat the body is facing. However, they have certain basic roles which have been explained here.

163,c-MfcZFmGTY,Science ABC,Newton‚Äôs Second Law: Spiderman And The Death Of Gwen Stacy,"Did you know that Gwen stacy's death and Newton‚Äôs second law of motion have a connection? In the comics ‚ÄúThe Amazing Spiderman‚Äù, Gwen Stacy dies after she is pushed off a bridge. Spiderman jumps behind her to catch her in his webbing, but he couldn‚Äôt save her. This entire situation that involves the death of Gwen Stacy is connected to the second law of motion postulated by Newton. 

Every individual on earth, whether they are a regular fellow or a superhero, are bound by the three laws of motion proposed by eminent scientist Sir Isaac Newton. In this video, we are going to discuss how Spiderman, a popular Marvel world superhero, learnt the application of the second law of motion through a heartbreaking incident - the death of Gwen Stacy - his girlfriend.

Newton‚Äôs second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. In one of the editions of the Amazing Spiderman comic series, Gwen Stacy is thrown off a bridge. Spiderman shoots his web to catch her, and he does catch her too. But to his utter shock and dismay, it's his web that ultimately resulted in the death of Gwen Stacy.

Let's look at how it all happened and how Spiderman changed his tactic of saving free falling victims after learning the proper application of the second law of motion.

This video inspired by a chapter in the book ‚ÄúThe Physics of Superheroes‚Äù authored by James Kakalios - a physics professor at the University of Minnesota.

Albert Einstein is the most popular physicist, as he formulated the theory of relativity, which gave the Energy mass equivalence formula and is directly related to time dilation. But what is time dilation? Time dilation and space time are interrelated. Einstein made one of the most important contributions to physics and had the concept of space time explained. A simple explanation of space time is that it is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. But it is very important to understand that the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are different. In this short animated video, we give a simple explanation of time dilation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity and also explain how time slows down in a moving vehicle!

Watch next month's video right now on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/occ/latest
Watch Wendover's Logistics of Coal Mining video here: https://nebula.tv/videos/wendover-the-logistics-of-coal-mining?ref=occ

This video leaned very heavily on Andreas Malm's book Fossil Capital. Check it out here: https://www.versobooks.com/products/135-fossil-capital 

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the birth of industrial capitalism led to the birth of fossil fuel use at an industrial scale. Specifically, I look at how capitalist forces led factory owners to embrace fossil fuels over water power, despite water being cheaper and more prevalent. Ultimately, capitalism needs power that is both flexible in time and consistent in space and fossil fuels were able to cater to that.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I examine the causes and destruction of our current industrialized food system. Specifically, I dive into the capitalist commodification of food, and how most of the industrialized farming that takes place in the imperial core doesn't produce crops for our consumption. Instead, the majority of the ""food"" we grow goes toward animal feed and biofuels. In addition, the fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides that our current industrialized farming system gobbles up are derived from fossil fuels. Essentially, fossil fuel corporations are laundering their dirty fuels through the very chemicals farmers use to grow their crops. Our food system is broken. We're in desperate need of a new agro-ecological revolution.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I explore how patriarchy destroy the planet and drives climate change. Specifically, I look at how threads of patriarchal masculinities, like petromasculinity and ecomodern masculinity are wielded and pervade responses to the climate crisis. These patriarchal responses to climate change not only obstruct needed action, but they have devasting consequences for gender liberation and environmental health.

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I look at the validity of vegan and plant-based diets as a solution to climate change. I dive into the human and planetary toll of the meat industry, looking at the massive emissions toll of beef production as well as the exploitative conditions in meat processing plants. Ultimately, I consider whether veganism is an effective tool to dismantling the meat industry and mitigating climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I look at the looming threat of species extinction and biodiversity collapse. Specifically, I uncover the extent of the sixth mass extinction. What it is and how bad it's happening. Then, I work through the key drivers of the acceleration of species die-offs across the planet. I look at how climate change and land use change (read: deforestation) have destructive consequences for the biodiversity climate. Finally, the video dives into the capitalist forces driving this mass extinction event.

I leaned heavily on Siddharth Kara's book, Cobalt Red, for this video: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250284303/cobaltred

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I look at the horrors of the cobalt supply chain fueling the electric car and renewable revolution. Specifically, I zero in on cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo in under to uncover what exactly it takes to bring modern batteries to life. The conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo are dismal and are fueled by a long history of colonial plunder and imperialism. To forge an environmentally ethical world that avoids the worst of climate change, we cannot turn a blind eye.

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I take a brief look at China's climate responsibility. Specifically, I dig into whether or not China is the primary driver of climate change, or whether they are trying to build a zero-carbon future. When it comes to China, a country of more than 1.4 billion people, nothing is simple. Especially when it comes to climate change. China is home to massive coal production, but also massive renewables production. This video tries to figure out exactly what role China is playing on the global climate action stage.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at the importance of speculative climate fiction, sci-fi, and utopias for political movements. Specifically, I look at various short stories, films, and books that introduce us to worlds beyond capitalism, that have, in their own way addressed our ecological and climate crisis.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at what it really takes to save the planet. Specifically, I look at the role of fossil fuel infrastructure sabotage in the climate movement. I weigh whether property destruction and sabotage are useful strategies for the broader climate action movement. The video lends some historical context to a possible climate sabotage wing and examines the radical flank effect.

For this video, I leaned heavily on Andreas Malm's ""How To Blow Up A Pipeline"": https://www.versobooks.com/books/3665-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline

Ecofascism and fossil fascism.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why the myth of overpopulation is actually a problem. Specifically, I look at how overpopulation is leading to dangerous conclusions both on the right and the left. On the right, it's leading to conclusions of population control, murder, and ethnic cleansing. On the left, it manifests as birth control access, but is still couched in the ideas of population control. Overpopulation is ultimately a myth that at best distracts from the needed work of climate action, and at worst leads to violence.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why we need a war on capitalist Christmas. Specifically, I look at the history of how capitalism stole Christmas, and how we might be able to steal it back. Christmas wasn't always a holiday of private gift-giving, it used to be based in public revelry and the reversal of power. Capitalism has since transformed the holiday into one based on the accumulation of material goods. This needs to change.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at climate hypocrisy and carbon guilt. Specifically, I dig into why I don't care about your flight emissions, and how our attention to individual carbon footprints and worries about being seen as hypocritical distract from the task of dismantling the fossil fuel industry. Indeed, the fossil fuel industry and pundits allied with oil and gas wield the negativity of hypocrisy to stymie climate movements and fracture power. In short climate hypocrisy and carbon guilt individualizes a crisis that can only be tackled collectively.

I highly recommend checking out this article by writer Mary Annaise Heglar  (which definitely influenced this video): https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/28/18629833/climate-change-2019-green-new-deal

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the rich really cause climate change. Specifically, I look at how the focus on the richest people in the world's consumption habits (i.e. our obsession with Taylor Swift's jet emissions) distracts us from how they make their money in the first place. It is through their control and power over production that the rich drive emissions through the roof in pursuit of profits. In order to understand the climate crisis, in order to understand what's driving the climate crisis, we need to look beyond individual footprints and toward the point of production. It is here where the rampant emissions stem from. At the point of production, a handful of individuals make choices that have dire ramifications for billions and dark consequences for the environment.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why fast fashion must end. Specifically, I look at the horrors of both worker and planetary exploitation of the fashion industry. The history of fashion parallels that of industrial capitalism. The pollution and worker exploitation of 18th and 19th-century textile mills and factories have just been upgraded and exported to the 21st century. Today with brands like ASOS, Shein, and H&M fashion has turned fast fashion into ultra-fast fashion with extremely quick turnarounds and daily style releases crushing workers in the imperial periphery and pumping emissions into the atmosphere. The current state of the fashion industry is destroying our planet and our very lives.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why the suburbs are so terrible for people and the planet. Specifically, I look at the racist history of the suburbs in the United States in order to understand how the suburbs came about. The suburbs have a dark history of white supremacy and settler colonialism that suburbanites still wrestle with today. Suburban design, a result of white flight and fear of the perceived ills of the city,  locked in a way of living and a way of moving about the landscape that is incompatible with the environment. The suburban lifestyle is not sustainable, both in terms of our well-being and our planet.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why disaster capitalism exists and how it works. Specifically, I dive into the core principles behind disaster capitalism-- how crises are exploited to pass neoliberal policies, turn a profit, and privatize land and resources previously held in common. But I also dive into how climate change and the climate crisis are a gold mine for disaster capitalism. Not only does capitalism destabilize communities on the frontlines of climate change and climate disasters, but it also capitalizes on the destruction of these natural disasters, further entrenching free-market capitalist ideas and policies. Capitalism is fueling climate change as well as profiting and exploiting the wreckage it leaves in its wake.

Check out the full-length companion video on Capitalism's biggest gamble here: https://nebula.app/videos/occ-capitalisms-biggest-gamble

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why work is killing us and the planet. Specifically, I unpack how wage work under capitalism is inherently a system of exploitation of people and planet. In order to truly forge a zero-carbon world, we must do away with wage work and transform our relationship with work. Culturally, economically, and politically we are forced to work the majority of our lives, often in meaningless positions or doing environmentally destructive tasks. The end of work might start with something like the four-day work week, but it must go farther into establishing a world wherein we don‚Äôt have to work to survive but instead work for pleasure.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at whether seaweed and kelp farming can save the planet and curb emissions like its promoters say seaweed does. Seaweed farming has existed for centuries but it only recently has come into the spotlight in the imperial core for its potential to grow food and animal feed as well as suck thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and emissions out of the air. Seaweed farming could be an essential tool in mitigating emissions and drawing down millions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and back into the earth.

Check out Andrewism's video here: https://youtu.be/Rz51PkJy2c0

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at ways in which we can build a Solarpunk future right now. Solarpunk envisions a world in which nature and humanity are seamlessly intertwined, and it does this through a combination of low and high-tech stools as well as political ideologies that center on justice and the environment. Solarpunk solutions might look like Earthships which are already being constructed around the world with hand tools and human ingenuity. Earthships employ many principles of design that lend well to a Solarpunk world. Earthships are generally made from recycled materials and are rammed full of packed dirt local to the area. The Earthship takes advantage of the sun and the wind through passive heating and cooling as well as solar panels, it collects rainwater, and incorporates nature into the house through indoor greenhouses that connect the Earthship dweller with nature as well as provide resilience. There are also Solarpunk solutions readily available right now for transportation. That comes in the form of sailing in the form 21st century. Sailing is a Solarpunk solution because its ties our economy and our materials to the rhythms of the sea and of nature. Ultimately Solarpunk envisions a world that might be slower, but more intentional. One that ties humanity closely to the natural world. Luckily we already have many Solarpunk tools to create that future at our disposal today.

Find the Nebula extended video here: https://nebula.tv/videos/occ-why-electric-cars-wont-save-us

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why electric cars won't save us. Specifically, I unpack why electric cars still have emissions tied to them as well as solidify imperialist extraction in the global south. That being said, electric cars are still much better for the planet and for people than gas-powered, fossil fuel-guzzling cars. My question, however, is whether completely replacing gas cars with electric cars is a justice-oriented answer to the climate crisis. To that, I offer up free and electrified public transportation like trams and buses as an alternative that would expand access to cities, especially for low-income people, and minimize our material footprint. Public transportation is essential to creating an ethical and ecologically focused future.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how climate change will create a massive refugee crisis and how militarized borders are making the climate crisis worse. Specifically, I look at a number of studies that project hundreds of millions of people will be displaced from their homes due to climate change by the end of the century. Unfortunately, imperial core countries like the United States have started building walls to keep people out instead of building bridges to help people escape the storm that the imperial core is largely to blame for. Militarized borders will only make the climate refugee crisis worse, so it's no wonder that the ties between private border security contractors and fossil fuel companies are intimate. In a time when the imperial core needs to be repaying their climate debt and helping countries in the imperial periphery adapt and thrive in a zero-carbon future, they are doing the exact opposite and strengthening their borders and surveillance states.

Check out the extended edition of this video here: https://nebula.tv/videos/occ-how-the-us-stole-land-from-millions-of-black-farmers

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at the history of Black farmers in the United States. Specifically, I look at how systems of oppression, slavery, and the racist machinations of the USDA dispossessed Black farmers of copious amounts of land. Over the course of three centuries, white settlers and white supremacist governmental operations made it extremely hard to be a Black farmer. That being said, Black farmers have a rich history of resistance and collective struggle. From farmer's unions to the Black belt communist and sharecropper uprisings, to the teachings and innovations of Booker T. Whatley and George Washington Carver, Black farmers have pushed back against America's white supremacist industrial agricultural system. In doing so, black farmers have developed agricultural techniques that guide us towards new anti-racist, anti-colonial, and anti-capitalist paths.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why we need radical climate hope and optimism. Specifically, I look at the roots of doomerism and anxiety and offer up radical climate hope as an alternative. To be clear this is not the pie-in-the-sky hope that ignores systems of oppression and waits around for savior tech. ologies to deliver us from climate chaos. No. This is a hope that envisions a liberated world where climate action is taken seriously and intertwines with other movements for justice. Radical revolutionary climate hope requires us to understand the systems of oppression that surround us and then in defiance imagine and create a better world.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how corporations use greenwashing to not only mask their polluting practices but also change what change means. Specifically, I look at how greenwashing is just another example of the resilience of capitalism. Greenwashing allows companies and corporations like Fiji, Coke, and Nestle to continue polluting and emitting. By telling its consumers that they're doing good and then turning around and doing the exact opposite, these big multinationals are able to protect their bottom line. In order to greenwash, companies only have to throw a pittance at sustainability projects and then just market their ""green initiatives"" heavily. Greenwashing is an insidious tool of the capitalist class and is crushing our ability to decipher what is actually making change.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I explain why America will never be a climate leader. Specifically, I look at how the United States has spent over 40 years attempting to pass climate legislation and take climate action but because of partisan gridlock and the firm hold fossil fuel companies and the capitalist class have on the government, nothing substantial has gotten done. As a result, the emissions levels of the United States are much higher than in the 1980s. But the United States not only has failed on climate change and climate leadership domestically but also internationally. The United States continues to block climate agendas that foreground climate reparations, and through its massive military pollutes the air and destabilizes regions especially susceptible to climate change. The United States will never be a climate leader because it is a huge obstacle to effective climate justice and climate action.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why eco-modernism is not not only not a solution to the climate crisis, but also could create a capitalist climate disaster.  Eco-modernism, at its core, is a capitalist philosophy that seeks to escape climate change and environmental destruction through technological innovation, agricultural intensification, and city densification. Elon Musk and Bill Gates are perfect examples of eco-modernist. Both seek to harness current, and more importantly, future technologies like carbon capture and next-generation nuclear reactors to decouple emissions from economic growth. Ultimately eco-modernism seeks to maintain business-as-usual capitalism by relying on untested technologies and unproven theories.

This Our Changing Climate climate change video spotlight's video on climate anxiety. In it, he gives some suggestions on how to transform climate anxiety into effective climate action with this video! With the ongoing climate crisis, it is easy to feel anxious and hopeless but action is our only way out. This is a video to encourage hope and optimism towards climate action.

With ecosystems around the world being destroyed, the sixth mass extinction going on, more intense hurricanes and heatwaves, and the average global temperatures rising- it is natural to feel extremely anxious and even spend sleepless nights worrying about our future.  There is a real term for this suffering and fear for our survival - climate anxiety.

A team from the University of Bath surveyed 10,000 children and young people (aged 16-25 years) in ten countries for climate anxiety.  Nearly 60% of the respondents were extremely worried about climate change and felt sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. 

We can make a difference in climate action via Drawdown and Regenerative solutions. The video also features  @Climate Town  for his eloquent description of organizations to join for climate action. Check out his channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVLG9pThvBABcYCm7pkNkA

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how capitalism and consumerism stole the holidays, specifically Christmas. Specifically, I look at how the holiday season has been bogged down by rampant consumerism. Consumerism born out of the relentless drive for profit and growth of capitalism. As a result of these pursuits, the environmental toll has been catastrophic. Presents and gift-giving continue to increase and much gets exchanged, sent back, or ends up in the landfill. These add to the amount of waste and emissions we already create under capitalism. Ultimately, the only path forward is to work towards the fall of capitalism and imperialism and in its place embrace political tendencies like ecosocialism or ecoanarchism that seek liberation for the masses while nurturing an ethical relationship with the natural world.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video short, I look at why tree planting is not the silver bullet carbon sequestration method so many think it is. While trees have the potential to sequester lots of carbon from the air, the time it takes them to mature, the susceptibility to wildfires, and the fact they are often planted in monocultures mean that they are less effective than we would like to believe.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why net zero emissions targets are a scam. Specifically I look at how the promises of net zero at COP26 will not actually mitigate climate change quickly. Net zero emissions does not mean zero emissions. Countries and companies like BP can use the net zero emissions goals and targets to continue burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide, ultimately fueling the climate crisis, while they rely on the false promise of carbon capture and carbon sequestration techniques like tree planting or technologies that haven't even been invented yet. Essentially, net zero emissions schemes allow for a worsening of the climate crisis because they are a procrastination technique for countries and corporations who do not want to reduce their emissions. Because of the vague definition of net zero, even fossil fuel companies like BP could call themselves net zero yet still continue with business as usual.

This video features the wonderful work of Saint Andrewism all about how and why permablitzing is an essential part of any climate action toolkit. Permablitz, a contraction of permaculture and blitz seeks to enact the principles and designs of permaculture onto the local landscape through quick direct and collective action. Permablitzing can mean gathering your friends or community members to build a community garden over the course of the day or moving through the streets and planting edible flowers and plants in vacant lots or sidewalk greenways. Permablitzing has the potential to quickly and easily green your local surroundings while also strengthening the connections between community members

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why plastic isn't the only threat to our seas and oceans. Specifically, I look at how overfishing threatens fisheries fish populations. worldwide. Overfishing has already decimated Atlantic cod and bluefin tuna fisheries and threatens many more. Fishing as a practice has been a staple in many diets for thousands of years but it wasn't until the commodification of fish under capitalism and the heightened industrialization of the fishing trades that global fish population and stocks began to seriously plummet. With inventions like the bottom trawler and big net fishing, fisherfolk are able to catch copious amounts in comparably little time. Overfishing has been devasting to the rich biodiversity of the oceans, rendering some areas devoid of important fish species. So, while ocean plastic and ocean trash clean-up efforts like #teamseas are at least doing something, there is much more threatening our oceans than plastic.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how we end climate imperialism through climate debt. With COP 26 on our doorstep, it's more important than ever to talk about climate debt and climate imperialism. Climate debt is a concept developed to reveal the unequal relationship between Global North (the imperial core) and the Global South (the imperial periphery) caused by centuries of imperialism, colonialism, and climate change. Climate debt demands countries in the imperial core pay reparations for the damage they've done to people, atmosphere and planet. For countless COPs countries in the imperial periphery have pushed for repayment of climate debts, but have been rebuffed over and over. In part, this is why The World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth took place in Cochabamba in 2010. Indeed, the People's Agreement that came out of the Cochabamba People's Conference highlights climate debt as an essential tool in the fight to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I answer the question, can small-scale farming feed the world? Specifically, I look at how industrial farming and the green revolution have led to increased farming emissions and severely depleted soil health. Small-scale farming, which I define as regenerative farms employing traditional knowledge, crop diversity,  and low carbon tools, can not only feed the world but do so in a manner that mitigates and possibly reverses the effects of climate chaos and industrial agriculture. Small-scale farms also offer a place to build movement power. A refuge to build people power and transform our current untenable capitalist system. Small-scale farming can mean big change.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why solarpunk gives me hope for the future in a world ravaged by climate change and climate chaos. Specifically, I answer the question, what is solarpunk? As well as propose tangible solarpunk solutions like solar cookers and solar ovens, makerspaces, and 21st-century zero-carbon airships. Solarpunk presents a vision of the world that is simultaneously hopeful and worth fighting for. Solarpunk envisions a more just future that incorporates leftist liberatory ideologies into a world that has successfully established a world that is both human-centric and nature-centric. As a result, solarpunk stands in stark opposition to the current capitalist profit-centric world we live in. Solarpunk gives us art, dreams, and culture that are worth fighting for, and it grounds that future in the tools and technology already available.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why these tipping points are code red for our planet and how the climate crisis and capitalism are driving us closer to the edge. Specifically, I look at climate tipping points like the Amazon rainforest dieback and the melting of the permafrost in order to grasp what exactly is at stake if we don't act now on climate change and the climate crisis. The Amazon rainforest dieback tipping point is currently being driven by Amazon rainforest deforestation and climate change-driven extreme heat. and wildfires. If left unchecked, climate change and deforestation could mean an irreversible die-off of the Amazon rainforest. Another tipping point of consequence is the melting of the permafrost. Permafrost melt creates a positive feedback look and could potentially release hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 and methane into the air, further warming the climate. Tipping points then show us that action needs to be taken right now or else irreversible consequences will soon arrive.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how United States imperialism is causing climate change and killing the world. Specifically, I look at how the United States is responsible for a large amount of the world's cumulative emissions, the birthplace of the oil industry, and now fosters a growing natural gas industry. While the United States has promised substantial. emissions cuts, they are too slow and too late. The United States' imperialist endeavors abroad have also worked to destabilize regions and prevent resilience in the face of climate change. From protecting oil fields and fossil fuel interests in the Gulf and Iraq Wars to various attempted coups, United States imperialism has made it that much harder to deal with climate change. In addition, United States-backed sanctions have also dealt crushing blows to countries try to build resilience in the face of COVID-19 and the climate crisis. In short, driven by profit and territorial expansion, the United States is not only causing climate change but also making it worse for those on the frontlines.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video, I look at how hemp could save the world from climate change. Obviously, there‚Äôs no one solution to climate change, but hemp and hemp cultivation could unlock a lot of alternatives to industries that currently emit tons of CO2 every year. Hemp is not only beneficial for the soil, but it also sequesters a substantial amount of carbon dioxide. Also, hemp is one of the fastest-growing crops. Hemp has over 25,000 uses which means, if grown right, hemp could replace everything from cotton to concrete to plastic and sequester millions of tons of carbon in the process. Hemp is truly a miracle crop and should be seen as a plant that‚Äôs sustainable and a viable solution to countless problems we now face in the climate crisis.

In this special Our Changing Climate video, I showcase Aime Maggie's video on sustainable housing. The video dives into why suburbs are terrible for the environment, how highways destroy habitat and ultimately lead to a decrease in biodiversity. Aime also touches on white flight and the connections between city planning and suburbs with racism. Ultimately Aime looks at the reality of urban decay and possible solutions and avenues through which we might be able to create more sustainable housing and ultimately cities.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why Elon Musk won't save us from climate change. Specifically, I look at how Elon Musk's companies like Tesla and SpaceX adhere to a. philosophy of ecomodernism that employs ideologies of techno-optimism and decoupling to tackling the problems of the climate crisis. Elon Musk won't save us because companies like Tesla are exploiting workers in Tesla factories, as well as utilizing capitalist, colonialist methods of extraction that rely on child labor in cobalt and lithium mines. Elon Musk's future is one where the ruling class enjoys the luxuries of his companies like the Tesla Cybertruck or the Las Vegas Loop System, or even a martian space colony, all at the expense of laborers and the working class. Elon Musk shows that ecomodernism is an untenable solution to the climate crisis and climate change. Not only does decoupling not work, but futuristic technologies have very tangible consequences for people and for the planet.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why celebrities won't save us from climate change. Specifically, I look at how celebrities like Leonard DiCaprio and Jane Fonda approach climate action and climate change in order to figure out whether celebrities are actually creating the change we need in order to address climate change and the climate crisis. Leonardo DiCaprio represents a more top-down celebrity approach to climate action. Choosing the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation as one of his main vectors of climate action. Leonardo DiCaprio does wield his wealth for climate action but his approach is very much in line with neoliberal capitalist thinking that exacerbated the climate crisis. Jane Fonda, on the other hand, seems to be taking a movement-based approach to wielding her celebrity.  Jane Fonda uses direct action and getting arrested as a method to shine the spotlight on the work being done on the frontlines as well as work dismantling capitalist extraction industries. Ultimately Jane Fonda and Leonardo DiCaprio represent different approaches to how celebrities use their fame to spur climate action.

Watch the extended version of this video here: https://nebula.tv/videos/our-changing-climate-why-lawns-must-die

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why the American lawn must die. Specifically, I look at the grass lawn's history of class exploitation and settler colonialism and how that ties into the American lawn culture we see today. The lawn began in Europe as an elite status symbol that was tended and mowed by peasants freshly forced into wage labor through the enclosure of the commons. The turfgrass lawn was then exported to colonial America where it was used as a tool to terraform indigenous land. And in the post-WWII suburban boom, the lawn soon became a symbol of white conformity. The turfgrass lawn though has a huge environmental impact. It's the biggest crop in the United States by area and requires a massive amount of fossil fuels, fertilizer, and chemicals to upkeep. Even if you don't want to tend to your lawn, some towns require you, with the threat of jail time to mow the grass. Ultimately, the grass lawn is a tool of capitalist settler colonialism that is exacerbating climate change and the climate crisis.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how we end consumerism. Specifically, I unpack how degrowth and ecosocialism can work in tandem to stop consumerism and overconsumption and reduce emissions in order to transition to a zero-carbon, post-climate change world. Degrowth is a response to the rampant growth/profit capitalist paradigm that fuels consumerism and is causing climate change. Degrowth de-centers capitalism and consumerism and instead argues for a world wherein there's a planned contraction of rich economies to allow for the well-being of everyone in the world. Degrowth, however, can't function well without ecosocialism. Ecosocialism recognizes that the climate crisis is a capitalist crisis and vice versa. In order for degrowth to work it needs to incorporate full democratic control of the means of production and the state in order to avoid draconian measures of austerity. Degrowth and ecosocialism represent an end to consumerism and overconsumption.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why billionaires won't save us from climate change. Specifically, I look at how the elite philanthropy of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk function as more of a billionaire preservation of wealth and self than as an act of altruism. Elite philanthropy from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos in particular seem to solidify their political and social power even more. Bill Gates and his foundation have steered the realm of global health for quite some time (especially during the pandemic) and it seems as if he is using his billionaire wealth to do the same for climate action. Jeff Bezos' $10 billion Earth Fund seems to be functioning in a similar way while also whitewashing the destructive nature of Amazon, aka how Jeff Bezos made his money. Elon Musk is also jumping on the billionaire philanthropy train with a carbon capture prize that is measly compared to his massive wealth. At the end of the day billionaires and billionaire money are not solutions to climate change and the climate crisis, we are.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why capitalism is killing us (and the planet) by causing climate change. Specifically, I look at how capitalism's multinationals like ExxonMobil and BP are responsible for increased emissions and ultimately the climate crisis we are living through today. Capitalism's growth-at-all-costs paradigm runs counter to the material realities of the Earth we live on. In addition to causing climate change, capitalists have found insidious ways to profit off of and engrain free market, neoliberal ideas into the global economy in the wake of climate change-fueled disasters. This is called disaster capitalism and will only get worse as the climate crisis causes more and more chaos. Flying in the face of this capitalist destruction are countless revolutionary movements and ideas that are working to dismantle the profit and growth economy and lift up the people instead. Eco-socialism moving into communism, degrowth, buen vivir, and food sovereignty are just a few philosophical tactics that are being championed by the masses as a means of countering the destructive tendencies of capitalism.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at an aspect of plastic pollution that often is ignored in the face of plastic pollution in the ocean. While ocean plastic pollution is an important issue, plastic is actually a fossil fuel production. This means that the emissions from plastic creation are massive. Unfortunately, the fossil fuel industry sees plastic as a plan B in the face of a renewables transition. This means that plastic pollution in the ocean and the atmosphere will only rise as fossil fuel industries seek to cover their losses. Unfortunately, recycling plastic is not a viable solution. Recycling plastic is actually an industry-backed tool to get people to buy more plastic without actually recycling most of the plastic, leading to lots of plastic pollution. At the end of the day, only bans and a transition away from plastic can halt plastic pollution both in terms of emissions and ocean plastic pollution.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at the true cost of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. Specifically, I look at how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built to fail, not necessarily in the monetary sense, but in terms of the impact Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies have on the environment. Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are not viable solutions to the current financial system because cryptocurrency's blockchain proof-of-work model requires a massive amount of electricity consumption. Essentially Bitcoin miners or other miners of cryptocurrencies use specialized computers to solve math problems and the end result is more Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. This process of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining, however, is environmentally destructive and unsustainable because it demands a huge amount of energy. There are some potential solutions to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency's energy and environmental cost. Switching to a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency model could drastically reduce cryptocurrency's environmental harms. That being said, switching models still doesn't address the rise of crypto-colonialism in places like Puerto Rico.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the Fairphone is one of the most sustainable and ethical smartphones on the market today. From the Fairphone 2 to the Fairphone 3 and now with the newly upgraded Fairphone 3 plus, Fairphone has slowly worked to create the greenest,  most sustainable smartphone that emphasizes modular design alongside an ethical supply chain and conflict-free minerals. The Fairphone 3 plus smartphone's carbon footprint is half the carbon footprint of Apple's iPhone 12 smartphone. One of the biggest sustainable design mechanics of the Fairphone 3 plus is its modular smartphone design. The Fairphone 3 plus' modularity means that the battery can be replaced in seconds, while the Fairphone's screen can be replaced in minutes. In short, the Fairphone 3 plus is one the most sustainable phones in the smartphone space today.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how white supremacy pervades not only the history of environmentalism and environmentalist leaders, but also how white supremacy now threatens the climate change movement and climate action today. The forefathers of environmentalism, conservation, and preservation like Gifford Pinchot, John Muir, and Teddy Roosevelt all espoused white supremacist ideas that were often intermeshed with their views of the natural world and environmentalism. Later as authors like Paul Ehlrich stoked fears of overpopulation, these racist sentiments were blended once again into concerns about overpopulation. In short overpopulation and environmental destruction as a result of overpopulation were wielded as racist and white supremacist tools to oppress people of color, especially in the majority world. Now, mass shooters and eco-fascists are harkening back to the environmentalist, racist, white supremacist views of the past and using climate change as a dangerous weapon and excuse to harm people.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the electric car was popular in the 1900s and then everything changed. Specifically, I look at how electric cars have been around multiple times and have failed not because of engineering failures but because of cultural and societal issues. Electric cars like Tesla and GM's new electric cars might be the turning point in the road for the electric car, but if we look back at history, the electric car has always faced an uphill battle. Norway's electric car program has been instrumental in showing the world that in order to create an electric car infrastructure, we need to emphasize electric car subsidies, electric car charging stations, and much more. It is possible to transition quickly away from electric cars, we just have to put the effort in to get us there.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how concrete and cement are destroying the planet. Specifically, I unpack why and how concrete and cement work, how concrete and cement create greenhouse gas emissions, how concrete causes climate change, and I also look at the possibility of green cement and concrete. Concrete, through the chemical processes that occur during the production phase, produces a lot of carbon dioxide emissions. For this reason, the concrete industry is one of the largest contributors of greenhouse gases in the world. That also means, however, that concrete could prove a perfect solution to fighting climate change. Green cement and concrete inventions are racking up. Some, like cement and concrete that could sequester and capture carbon leading the way to viable alternatives to conventional cement and concrete.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I answer the question does Evo Morales' eco-socialism work? Specifically, I look at the environmental and socialist actions of Evo Morales when he was president from when he took office in 2006 to the 2019 Bolivian coup that ousted Evo Morales from the presidency. Evo Morales was and still is an environmental champion in some respects, and his socialist agenda and indigenous socialism worked to bring the good life to many Bolivians. Still, Evo Morales participated in an environmentally destructive, capitalist, extractivist global economy. As a result, Bolivia and Evo Morales socialism still caused extraction and environmental harm. At the end of the day though, Evo Morales' eco-socialism and socialist agendas were not the panaceas to climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I answer the question is vertical farming is the future of food? Specifically, the video looks at the problem with vertical farming, the benefits of vertical farming, as well as whether vertical farming is actually a viable solution to solving hunger and combatting climate change. While there are many benefits to vertical farming, like water conservation, location, seasonality, and pest prevention, the current costs and energy requirements of hydroponic and aeroponic vertical farming operations mean they are very costly. Ultimately hydroponic and aeroponic vertical farms have a long way to go before they are an actual solution to sustainable food production, especially when addressing issues like food waste and food infrastructure might be more beneficial.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why planned obsolescence happens and how planned obsolescence creates waste and emissions. Specifically, I show how planned obsolescence is a symptom of late-stage capitalism and how companies like Apple use perceived and planned obsolescence to make customers buy more of their products. Apple uses planned obsolescence in their batteries and hardware to the extent that once their warranty is up, their devices generally begin to fail. Apple has been sued numerous times for planned obsolescence by Right to Repair campaigns and governments like France claiming that Apple slows down their iPhones, makes it hard to repair iPhones, and generally making iPhones and Mac computers with shorter lifespans. Planned obsolescence is a symptom of late-stage capitalism that pervades a lot of big corporations because it means more consumption ultimately more profit.

In this special Our Changing Climate video, I showcase Rollie at Climate Town's video all about why your carbon footprint is a scam. Through this carbon footprint video, Rollie reveals how and why the BP oil created the idea of the carbon footprint. Over the course of multiple decades, BP used the idea of a carbon footprint to push the responsibility and the burden of carbon emissions onto the individual and away from their own practices. Essentially BP created the carbon footprint as an elaborate victim-blaming scheme. Your carbon footprint matters, but the reason why you have a carbon footprint in the first place is that fossil fuel companies like BP have fought tooth and nail against any kind of transition away from oil and gas.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, we look at how and why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. We look at the last 30 years of television comedies that address climate change from The Simpsons to South Park to The Good Place to Modern Family to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to understand why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. TV comedies use a number of character archetypes that turn environmentalists into obnoxious pariahs, directly deny the existence of climate change in the case of South Park, or build jokes and comedic elements on how hopeless climate action can be. TV comedies ultimately have undermined needed progress on climate change and climate action by approaching the issue of climate change in an unproductive way. To conclude we offer a number of avenues through which TV comedies like The Simpsons, The Politician, and The Good Place might be able to actually spur climate action through jokes and comedy. 

Big thanks to Kate Carter and the NCSE graduate student outreach fellows! They researched and wrote the script for this video.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the problem with grass-fed beef. Grass-fed beef, holistic grazing, and regenerative grazing have recently been championed as solutions to climate change and the climate crisis. The truth about grass-fed beef is that it can't sequester as much carbon as grass-fed, regenerative beef grazing advocates like Allan Savory say it can. Counter to the promises of grass-fed beef and regenerative beef advocates like Allan Savory, most grass-fed beef grazing operations cause more emissions than they capture. Ultimately, grass-fed beef and regenerative beef grazing systems are an unsustainable practice. The real solution is to embrace some form of a plant-based diet. Whether that means going vegan, vegetarian, or forgoing red meat to start, plant-based diets like eating vegan create far fewer emissions than eating grass-fed beef.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the problem with consumerism. Specifically, the video looks at how consumerism and consumption levels negate the environmental benefits of sustainable green growth. As we consume and consume, our consumption levels of materials and energy go up, requiring a larger renewable energy transition to cover. With holidays like Christmas and Black Friday imploring consumers to buy more with deals and advertisements galore. The problem with consumerism, consumption, our materialistic obsessions, and a capitalist growth-centered is that it blocks the amazing progress we've made on the energy efficiency and renewables front. Ultimately, consumerism and consumption must be corrected by a state of deconsumption, degrowth, and minimalism in rich countries. Contracting consumption rates and embracing degrowth, minimalism, and essentialism will make a transition to a 100% renewable world that much better.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at 3 climate change solutions that could actually happen. Climate change solutions and global warming solutions like rooftop solar panels, electric trains, and food waste, the world has so many available ways to drawdown greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. This video dives into just 3 climate change solutions: refrigerant management, onshore wind turbines, and plant-rich or vegan diets. The models from Project Drawdown show that if refrigerant management, onshore wind turbines, and vegan or plant-based diets are scaled up around the globe we could potentially avoid millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions and be well on our way to tackling climate change. These climate change solutions all will require tremendous actions across all levels of society but could provide massive benefits as well.

With the final Donald Trump vs Joe Biden presidential debate wrapped up and the 2020 election drawing near, this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay video looks at what's at stake for climate change when the choice is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden's climate change plan is a surprisingly progressive agenda. Climate justice and climate mitigation are headliners of Joe Biden's climate plan, and the Green New Deal is even mentioned in Biden's climate plan. Compared to Joe Biden, Donald Trump has no climate plan, and a Donald Trump presidency could spell climate change disaster. The Trump White House has spent the last year dismantling countless pieces of environmental and climate change legislation. Unfortunately U.S. election system really only provides two choices: Donald Trump vs Joe Biden. And in this 2020 election, where climate change is a crucial issue, voting for Joe Biden is the better vote for climate action.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the real problem with GMO food, also known as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Specifically, we look at whether GMOs and GMO foods are actually bad both for the environment and for your health. GMOs and genetically modified food like soybeans or corn have long raised the ire of non-GMO food activists because they are supposedly frankenfood that will poison us, as a result, they embrace organic foods. GMO advocates champion genetically modified food as a way to combat climate change, solve environmental issues, and solve world hunger. There are truths and fallacies both of the extremes of the GMO debate, but the reality is, and really the core problem with GMOs is not the technology or the genetically modified food itself, but what GMOs and genetically modified foods are used and controlled. Monsanto's BT and HT crops are a perfect example of how GMO foods are used to create monopolies of environmental destruction.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the industrial agriculture and multinational food and seed corporation Monsanto, which is now owned by the company Bayer. Specifically, this video looks at how Monsanto and now Bayer continue to profit off of and perpetuate a toxic chemical and industrialized farm system through their food empire. I look at how Monsanto continues to sell glyphosate or Roundup despite the overwhelming evidence and lawsuits showing it's harmful effects on humans and animals. Monsanto and Bayer along with three other seed companies now control over 60% of the seed market by patenting GMO seeds. GMO seeds sold by Monsanto have led to increased industrialization and ultimately increased costs in rural areas. Monsanto has essentially created a food empire based on control of GMO seeds, toxic chemicals like neonicotinoids and Roundup glyphosate, and high costs systems that unsustainable for the earth, humans, and the pocketbooks of farmers.

180,G6sLBA-Z-rs,Our Changing Climate,"How This Urban Farm Creates 300,000 lbs of Compost by Hand","In this video brought to you by the Local Motives YouTube channel, we explore how a small community urban farm in Red Hook, Brooklyn produces over 150 tons of compost every year with just hand tools. Through the help of over 2000 volunteers, the Red Hook Community Urban Farm diverts over 300,000 lbs (pounds) of food scraps, food waste, and yard waste from the landfill. This NYC urban farm uses large piles of food waste to create compost. The NYC urban farm not only educates volunteers on how to compost and grow their own food in an urban agriculture environment, but they also put them to work turning compost piles to create the perfect soil for growing organic vegetables and produce. This is an excellent example of how small farms, collective work, and a good idea can make a big impact on climate change.

181,vB68xvRb2T4,Our Changing Climate,"Our Global Water Crisis, Explained.","In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, we look at our global freshwater crisis. Specifically, the video investigates how droughts in California and the Amazon lead to water scarcity for local residents, wildfires, and changing landscapes. These droughts are now exacerbated by climate change and will only make water scarcity and water access worse if drastic action is not taken to curb climate change. In addition, California's Central Valley shows clearly how agriculture can make droughts even worse by drawing unsustainable levels of water out of surrounding aquifers. The water crisis around the globe and in Central Valley has become so bad that many residents are forced to get bottled water because their tap or well water is contaminated or non-existent. In short, we're facing a global water crisis, a shortage of water that, if addressed through water conservation and climate change can be avoided.

The script for this video was written by NCSE Graduate Student Outreach Fellow Annie Stoeth.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at Coca-Cola's plastic pollution and water use and waste. Coca-Cola (Coke) has now become synonymous with plastic pollution and one audit of ocean trash claims Coke is the most polluting brand in terms of ocean plastic. In part, this is due to Coca-Cola's switch to plastic bottles in this U.S. in the middle of the 20th century. Plastic is much cheaper to produce but the costs are offloaded onto the oceans and environment. Coca-Cola (Coke) also heavily drains local watersheds and aquifers and in countless locations has led to crop loss and drought. Essentially, wherever Coke goes there's bound to be plastic pollution and water problems.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the solutions for and whether it's even possible to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050. Specifically, this video looks at the obstacles renewable technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, solar power, and solar energy face in the coming decade by unpacking some of the common arguments fielded against renewables. The documentary, Planet of Humans, was recently published and is a prime example of this kind of renewable bashing. Ultimately though, I show that the problems facing renewables like wind turbine energy and solar panel energy are surmountable through existing technologies like pumped-hydro storage and grid interconnectors. Ultimately, 100% renewable fossil-fuel-free energy is not only possible but necessary to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how The New York Times is in the oil business. Specifically, the video focuses on fossil fuel advertising in The New York Times in order to understand how The New York Times has aided companies like Exxon, Chevron, Mobil, and BP in reaching readers and viewers with their advertisements. The New York Times has allowed the oil and gas company Mobil and then later ExxonMobil to run countless advertorials in their opinion pages that look very similar to opinion pieces. Now, ExxonMobil and Chevron employ the New York Times through the Times' brand studio to create ads and advertising materials. The advertisements themselves are blatant greenwashing. One NY Times creation for ExxonMobil greenwashes them as a clean energy innovator when they so clearly not. This combination of fossil fuel companies and journalism could be a dangerous duo for climate change and climate action.

185,ypV58yWN8xw,Our Changing Climate,Why we need a Green New Deal right now.,"In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why a Green New Deal is so important right now. Championed in the U.S. by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), Ed Markey, and the Sunrise Movement, the Green New Deal offers a solution to global warming and climate change through broad social programs addressing not only fossil fuels but also racism, capitalism, ableism, and imperialism. Unlike other market-based climate legislation in the past, the Green New Deal recognizes the connection between climate change and the host of other struggles the U.S. and the globe faces. The Green New Deal represents a shift in the environmental movement from a scarcity mindset to one of abundance that seeks to supply guaranteed clean jobs for those who want them, sustainable housing, and an electrified transportation system all centered around environmental justice. With the recent Black Lives Matter uprisings fighting for racial justice all over the world, the Green New Deal is an essential idea for the modern environmental movement because it shows that you can not have climate action without a racial justice analysis.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why Walmart is so cheap. Specifically, the video investigates the hidden environmental costs of Walmart and tackles whether or not Walmart is actually as sustainable as they claim. For over a decade and a half, Walmart has asserted itself as an environmental leader by constructing new renewable projects, minimizing their waste, and leaning on their supply chain suppliers to become more sustainable. But Walmart's razor-thin margins, cheap costs, and hypergrowth mindset have made all of these sustainable efforts useless. Walmart is polluting more than ever and as it continues to roll out options like 2-hour shipping, it will move further from a zero-carbon company and towards an environmentally destructive one.

The video looks at the high emissions and pollution of unsustainable CAFOs and feedlots that McDonald's meat comes from. The video essay also looks at McDonald's other sustainable initiatives like plant-based meats and biodegradable packaging, but ultimately McDonald's sustainability efforts are always spurred by profit interests and not environmental concerns.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I join forces with @ClimateAdam to look at silver bullet geoengineering solutions to climate change. Specifically, we look at how silver bullet geoengineering ideas can be appealing in theory, but in practice they often have a lot of ethical, economic, and social drawbacks. We dive deep into two geoengineering practices that some are touting as climate saviors: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage and Solar Radiation Management (specifically Stratospheric Aerosol Injection). Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage is a very appealing geoengineering technology but it requires massive amounts of land if it is scaled up. Stratospheric Aerosol Injection essentially dims the sun and there are many climate-related drawbacks as well as political ramifications that could arise if we use aerosol injections as a way to stave off the worst of climate change. Essentially these geoengineering silver bullet propositions are in many ways an excuse for us to continue business as usual instead of digging in and actually reducing emissions.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, we look at how climate change is causing a decrease in biodiversity worldwide. Biodiversity is a measure of the variety and variability of life, and climate change is causing the decline of biodiversity in numerous ecosystems via extreme weather, sea-level rise, and habitat destruction. Biodiversity matters because without such a variety of life and species, ecosystems begin to collapse ultimately affecting the livelihoods of communities reliant on healthy, biodiverse ecosystems. Biodiversity loss caused by climate change ultimately means species extinctions and a disconnect between animals and plants.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how Donald Trump uses the Coronavirus (COVID-19) as an excuse and distraction in order to dismantle essential environmental regulations. With the world focused on the Coronavirus, the Trump administration has halted the EPA's environmental compliance enforcement wing, pushed through an anti-science and anti-environmental agenda, and reversed fuel efficiency standards among other environmental changes. COVID-19 has been an excellent excuse for the Trump administration to deregulate oil and gas industries but as a recent study shows, the air pollution from these industries could be exacerbating the Coronavirus pandemic. So, not only has the Trump administration bungled the response to COVID-19, but they are also actively making the Coronavirus, the environment, and climate change worse.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why Trader Joe's is so popular and whether it is really that sustainable? This video compliments Polymatter's video on Trader Joe's (linked below), with the purpose of looking at the four main ways Trader Joe's addresses its environmental impact. Through food waste, packaging, sourcing, and energy, Trader Joe's creates a mixed bag of environmental actions and impacts. It has thoroughly addressed its food waste problem and is beginning to minimize its packaging impact. But it's hard to tell where its products come from and they don't have any public emissions reduction plans. At the end of the day, Trader Joe's is not the most ethical or sustainable company. It listens to what its costumers want and does it. That's what makes it so popular as well.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the problem of food waste. Specifically, I look at how food waste both in America and across the world is a massive problem for climate change, the environment, and hunger. By addressing food waste in farms, grocery stores, and at home, we could potentially feed billions of people and curb the massive emissions generated to make food and from food waste that ends up in the landfill. There are some pretty simple fixes to food waste like creating a shopping list, using guides to figure out when your food actually spoils, or creating a compost area and then composting food scraps. As a Vox video on the topic puts it, food waste is the world's dumbest problem. But if we address food waste head-on, we will be well on our way to solving climate change and mitigating world hunger.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how we‚Äôve responded globally to the Coronavirus in order to understand how we should and could respond to climate change. Specifically, I look at how countries like China, South Korea, Singapore, Italy, and the United States have quickly mounted large governmental responses to the coronavirus. Covid-19 is a serious global and political crisis, but the coronavirus shows us that rapid behavioral and structural change is possible in the face of a crisis, and climate change is a crisis. The response to Coronavirus (Covid-19) has been quick and broad, the response to climate has been slow and small. If we treated climate change like we have Covid-19, also known as the coronavirus, we would be well on our way to zero-carbon future.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the social and environmental impacts of ExxonMobil's vast fossil fuel empire. From the Exxon Valdez Oil spill to their pipeline projects in Chad and Cameroon, ExxonMobil has carved a sharp path through communities and through the climate. ExxonMobil is so big that it essentially functions as its own country, able to influence and destabilize whole regions as well as pump millions of tons of fossil fuels into the air. ExxonMobil has also fueled an extensive campaign fighting climate science and climate action. By sponsoring think tanks and climate deniers, ExxonMobil has delayed necessary climate action for decades. Essentially, ExxonMobil is a private sector behemoth capable of destroying the environment and whole countries for decades to come.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I take on Amazon. Specifically, I look at how Amazon prime shipping and delivery services impact the environment and the workers who rush to fulfill such tight deadlines. Looking at shipping services like Amazon Flex and investigating the conditions in Amazon warehouses I try to answer the questions of why is Amazon so cheap? What does Amazon really cost In short, Amazon's grand theory of consistent need for speed to fulfill prime one-day and two-day ship orders means high environmental impacts and crushing loads on workers both in the warehouse and out for delivery. So, when you purchase an Amazon product the burden of that cheap price tag lands on workers and the environment.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what you can do about climate change using individual, personal, and collective actions. This video, however, is not a simple list of the best things a person can do to change their lifestyle and shrink their carbon footprint, instead I start by looking at the way in which we‚Äôve globally become fixated on individual solutions to climate change. We envision ourselves more as consumers than as citizens. As a result carbon footprint related actions like flying less and recycling are prioritized over voting, protesting, and system change. This video is all about doing both personal things to lower your carbon footprint like driving less, but simultaneously acting collectively to create a system in which having a small carbon footprint is feasible for everyone.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why Australia, the Amazon, and the Central African Congo Basin is on fire. Specifically, I look at the scope and damages of the Australian fires for the 2019-2020 fire season and compare them to those of the Amazon and Congo fires. The video also delves into how climate changes influences and enhances the damage of wildfires and has lead to more intense fires across Australia and the Amazon. But this video essay also shows that the deregulation stances of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are partly to blame for the increase of fires in their respective countries.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the corporate environmental and ethical actions of Recreation Equipment, Inc. (REI co-op) as well as their corporate responsibility structure in order to decide whether they are a co-op. REI co-op claims they are a member-based co-op, yet members have very little say in how the company is run. As such, the co-op name that REI co-op uses seems more like a marketing ploy than an actual business structure. In addition, this video looks at the environmental causes and plans put in place by REI co-op. While they are ambitious in their drive for ""Corporate Responsibility"", these methods seem to be in line with what their customers want to see, which ultimately means more sales and growth.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the true cost of coffee. Specifically, I look at how shade-grown coffee and sun-grown coffee are cultivated in order to understand the environmental and social consequences of consuming coffee. Worldwide, coffee is the second most popular beverage next to the water, and the large majority of it is produced in the Global South and imported into the Global North. As a result, the environmental destruction caused by sun-grown coffees pollutes and deforests producing countries in order to satiate the thirst for caffeine in Europe and North America.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the environmental and social cost of the military and militarism. I narrow in on the United States military-industrial complex because it is by far the biggest military machine in the world. I look at how the military and the military-industrial complex is a massive polluter in terms of both emissions and chemical waste. In addition, the video looks at whether or not these environmental and monetary burdens caused by the military-industrial complex are justified. Have the multitude of wars the United States has wage been just, or are they manifestations of imperialism. Ultimately, the video connects environmental destruction with military imperialism and concludes that demilitarization is the only truly effective answer to the carbon footprint of the military.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I investigate the various problems with Black Friday this 2019 season. Using Black Friday as a microcosm for the United States' desire for overconsumption, I look at the environmental impacts of Black Friday and Cyber Monday as well as the social problems of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Specifically, the video dives into the treatment of workers in large companies like Amazon and Walmart and then understands the environmental consequence of the massive consumption spree that is Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In short, the overconsumption of Black Friday is steeped in a profit-over-all model that we must escape if we are to change Black Friday.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at plant-based meats like Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger in order to understand how and why they are replacing conventional beef. Plant-based meats like the Impossible Burger seem to be trying to replacing the environmentally destructive practices of cattle factory farms which is definitely a positive. CAFOs or beef factory farms produce a lot of pollution, emissions, and are a leading cause of deforestation across the globe. Plant-based burger and meat companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods seek to replace these unsustainable practices with what they claim are much more environmentally friendly meats and burgers. But Impossible Burgers and Beyond Burgers are definitely a product of food-tech optimism and are only one solution to a much larger food system problem. While Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are doing a good job at offering viable alternatives they have a lot to work on.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why climate protests matters. Specifically, I look at environmental protests like the recent September climate strikes in order to understand protest's place in creating much-needed climate action. Via various organizations like the Sunrise Movement, Zero Hour, Fridays for Future, and One Million of Us, youth protests across the world are crying out to world leaders to act strongly on climate change. Greta Thunberg certainly has added fuel to this growing fire, but she's not the only climate protest leader. These movements show not only the strength and solidarity of a new wave of climate activists but the mounting pressure on politicians to create broad-based, inclusive, and transformative policies that combat climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why IKEA is so cheap as well as try to understand the environmental consequences of IKEA furniture's cheap cost. Specifically, I look at how IKEA's supply chain management, assemble-it-yourself, and questionable tax avoidance give rise to IKEA's cheap cost. In addition, I also evaluate IKEA as a sustainable company. I try to understand whether IKEA's sustainability goals are all talk or whether they are actually interested in creating an environmentally conscious furniture company.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the difficulties surrounding the Zero Waste lifestyle, especially for beginners. Specifically, I look at how the Zero Waste lifestyle is a good solution to individual waste and single-use items for those that are able, but for beginners, the extremes of Zero Waste can be daunting. So, Zero Waste alternatives are essential for those (or beginners) interested in creating meaningful and lasting change within their system. At the end of the day, Zero Waste can be effective but it can also be daunting and turn many people off exploring their relationship with waste.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the controversy and debate behind plastic straw bans. Specifically, I look at the minimal impact of plastic straws on ocean trash compared to other forms of garbage. The video also discusses how plastic straw bans are a form of eco-ableism in that eliminating plastic straws make the lives of people with disabilities much more complicated. As a result of the eco-ableism inherent in plastic straw bans, ridding whole cities of plastic straws could prove problematic.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the hidden costs and sustainable claims of Apple. Specifically, I look at Apple's efforts to reduce its environmental footprint through solar and wind projects. I also look at the repairability of Macs, iPhones, and iPads in order to figure out whether Apple's sustainability claims are marketing ploys or actual commitments. At the end of the day, Apple's products seem to fuel an increased desire for new and shiny tech, which ultimately leads to more e-waste.

At the end of the day, 4ocean does seem to be cleaning up trash, but it's hard to say how much of it is going to the actual ocean clean up efforts and how much is going into 4ocean's other endeavors.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the environmental impact of the internet. Specifically, I dig into how the internet works through data centers and networks, both of which contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions through massive energy demand. In all, the internet does have a huge energy demand, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it has to create a lot of emissions. If the data centers and networks behind the internet instead rely on renewable energies then the internet can possibly be a positive environmental force.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the effects of palm oil on the environment and deforestation. Specifically, I look at how palm oil demand has caused a huge increase in oil palm plantations. As a result, producers clear-cut, log and burn peatlands and primary rainforests in order to make way for palm oil fields. By itself, palm oil is not necessarily a harmful product, but because palm oil is now in thousands of products, the rate at which it's being consumed has caused deforestation and environmental destruction on a large scale.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the greenest form of travel. Specifically, I look at the carbon footprints and emissions of trains, cars, planes, and buses when traveling on vacation or for business. Ultimately, the greenest way to travel greatly depends on the context of the trip. For example, the number of passengers or distance travel greatly affects the efficiency and the ""greenness"" of the trip.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the true cost of Samsung smartphones like the Galaxy S10 and the Galaxy Fold. Specifically, I look at the environmental impact of Samsung's phone from manufacturing to waste and see whether they are an eco-friendly smartphone maker. Samsung has had problems with phones breaking in the past like the Galaxy Note 7, which has led to some environmentally disastrous recalls. Considering Samsung owns a large portion of the smartphone market, it's important to consider the environmental consequences of phones that are rushed to the market like the Galaxy Fold.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what role nuclear energy has to play in a renewable energy transition to combat climate change. Specifically, I figure out whether nuclear energy is emissions free or low carbon. I look at the problem of nuclear waste by weighing the differences between long term storage, on-site storage, and reprocessing of nuclear waste. I also look at the prohibitive cost and construction barriers to nuclear energy in order to understand whether it's actually a feasible solution to climate change. Finally, I look at the issue of safety in relation to nuclear energy by comparing the death tolls of other energy outputs to that of nuclear energy.

Because there are no Snopes pieces on the Ecosia, I figured it would be important see if Ecosia is actually planting trees as they claim, as well as try to figure out whether switching from Google to Ecosia makes sense.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I take a look at how recycling works and where recycled items go after they hit the recycling bin. Specifically, I follow a plastic bottle that makes its way from a recycling truck to the processing facility. That plastic bottle finally makes its way across the sea to a recycling plant. The main question this video seeks to answer is whether recycling works anymore and whether it's still environmentally friendly.

Specifically, I look at how The North Face seems to be torn between environmental actions and sustainability on the one hand and appeasing shareholders on the other. Ultimately, The North Face seems to follow the example of Patagonia and  Fj√§llr√§ven rather than challenging the outdoor industry to be environmentally ethical and sustainable leaders in their field.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I investigate the environmental impact of dockless scooters like Bird and Lime. I ask a simple question: are dockless scooters environmentally friendly? Unfortunately, the answer is not as simple, and the dockless scooter companies like Bird's sustainability depend on their context. They could have a low carbon footprint if they are replacing a car ride, but if not the scooters' environmental impact could be large. Basically, the environmental impact depends on the way we use a dockless scooter like Lime's.

Part of the reason why weed has such a large environmental impact and carbon footprint is that most growers farm weed indoors. Indoor growing operations require a large amount of energy, which ultimately means more greenhouse gasses in the air.

Things It Would Have Been Better to Know Before the Revolution offers us a chance to step back and reflect on what it truly means to mitigate climate change and ""heal"" our surroundings.

Specifically, I look at how sea level rise is getting worse on America's coastal cities by showing how they've been experiencing an increased amount of nuisance flooding as a result of rising oceans and climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I explained how federal lands have become embroiled in a battle between federal and state's rights. I look at how the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Forest Service, and the National Park Service are tasked with the difficult job of managing federal lands for multiple uses. As a result, this has led to events like the Sagebrush Rebellion and the struggle over Bears Ears National Monument.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I take a look at the concept of cultural landscapes. I specifically look at how the integration of natural landscapes and human landscapes can create a deep tradition of reverence for the local environment. Cultural landscapes might just offer viable alternatives to industrial agricultural and cultural systems that often overlook the health of the land.

This story from Avatar: The Last Airbender mirrors many real-world environmental problems where environmental racism runs rampant and the environmental justice movement seeks to combat.

The second is a characterization of wilderness as a place of transcendence--a construction that pulls heavily from the works of Thoreau and Emerson.

I specifically look at how climate change skepticism in ExxonMobil, which knew about human-caused climate change as far back as 1977, and yet constructed a campaign of disinformation and denial in order to shroud the mounting scientific evidence.

266,POWi60RblUI,Our Changing Climate,How the first Earth Day started a movement.,"A quick look at the history Earth Day and the environmental movements that it started in order to understand why the Peoples Climate Movement means hope for progressive climate action. Specifically, I look at how and why the first Earth Day didn't seem to created a progressive left vision that included and joined with the anti-war, civil rights, and women's liberation movements at the time. Instead, the first Earth Day was built upon a coalition of primarily white, middle-class folks interested in environmentalism. This has continued up to today but seems to be changing with the rise of environmental justice movements and the understanding that frontline communities should be those that lead and guide an environmental revolution.

Corrections:

1. Cook et al 2013 has come under increased scrutiny over the last couple years, and has some critical flaws. That being said, the results of multiple surveys of different size and method point to a growing consensus that climate change is real and very likely human caused. 
You can read more on Cook et al and scientific consensus on climate change here: https://hiizuru.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/campaign-of-deception/
As well as here: http://www.factcheck.org/2015/09/santorums-climate-consensus-claims/

2. There is still debate on what exactly caused the mass extinction at the end of the Permian period. Theories point to a large meteor strike, volcanic eruption, or runaway greenhouse emissions as the leading cause of death. (Also, I mistakenly implied that ice core records go back 250 million years. They don't. Ice records really only go back 800,000 years.)

285,6PLBEz7o6wc,NASA Climate Change,Antarctic Ice Mass Loss 2002-2023,"The Antarctic ice sheet's mass has changed over the last decades. Research based on satellite data indicates that between 2002 and 2023, Antarctica shed an average of 150 billion metric tons of ice per year, adding to global sea level rise.

These images, created from GRACE and GRACE-FO data, show changes in Antarctic ice mass since 2002. Orange and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002.

Areas in East Antarctica experienced modest amounts of mass gain due to increased snow accumulation. However, this gain is more than offset by significant ice mass loss on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (dark red) over the 21-year period. Floating ice shelves whose mass change GRACE & GRACE-FO do not measure are colored gray.

The average flow lines (gray; created from satellite radar interferometry) of Antarctica‚Äôs ice converge into the locations of prominent outlet glaciers, and coincide with areas of highest mass loss (i.e., Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West-Antarctica). This supports other observations that warming ocean waters around Antarctica play a key role in contemporary ice mass loss.

289,4-NbXFDj24s,NASA Climate Change,Implications of GRACE data for Water Resources Management,"Two decades of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data have significantly advanced our understanding of global hydrology. Variations in Earth‚Äôs gravity monitored by GRACE are controlled mostly by water storage changes, such as those related to droughts, floods, ice melting, and human water use.

The vertically integrated GRACE land total water storage (TWS) variations include surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater. The value of the GRACE TWS parameter is evident in its recent adoption in the IPCC reports as an essential climate variable in assessing climate impacts in hydrology and increasing use of TWS in global models.

Attribution analysis of GRACE water storage variability to human and climate drivers has greatly advanced over time. GRACE satellites were the first to show large scale groundwater depletion in the IndoGangetic Basin. Interpretation of GRACE water storage has improved by integrating additional data on human intervention (e.g., groundwater pumping, water use, land use change) and climate drivers (e.g., precipitation, drought indices).

Some basins show combined effects of human intervention amplifying or dampening climate effects. Recent studies show the value of ground-based monitoring and regional modeling to provide long-term context for GRACE data with large scale net increases in water storage in the IndoGangetic Basin and Northwest US over the past century.

Advances in GRACE processing shows potential value in operational mode for drought and flood warning. Continued advances in applications of GRACE data are expected by combining these data with other satellite data (e.g., SWOT, SMAP) and by using GRACE data to constrain models through data assimilation. The visual power of GRACE data helped communicate water storage variability to the public and influence water policy in many regions, including India and the US.

She was the first American woman to earn a Ph.D. in meteorology. Her path to the top was tortuous, multifaceted, and surprisingly complex ‚Äì an 86-year rollercoaster ride of passion, soaring intellect, and gritty determination to succeed in a man‚Äôs world at all cost and to blaze a trail for other women to follow.

Joanne managed to soar -- like a hot tower Cb -- above all adversity and established the fundamental importance of tropical clouds as the drivers of the global circulation. She led large airborne observing projects, built computerized cloud models, and participated in experimental seeding of hurricanes and clouds.

Her career culminated at NASA, where her most significant work, she said, was as project scientist for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, a satellite-based program launched in 1997 that employed radar and microwave imaging to unravel the dynamics of the tropics, which is home to up to half of the world‚Äôs people.

Given her many accomplishments, what is currently known about Joanne is not close to what should be known about her. I was told by her closest associates that this book gave them the opportunity to assemble all the pieces of her life they had come to know (and some they never knew) into a coherent and compelling story of the mentor they loved and respected. This talk provides a deep dive into Joanne‚Äôs life to situate her story.

291,XP5r-kZg13k,NASA Climate Change,Harnessing the Power of Geophysical Imaging to Recharge California‚Äôs Groundwater,"California‚Äôs past has involved cycles of floods and droughts, and this is predicted to continue, with more extreme floods and more extreme droughts due to climate change. There is now great interest in flood-MAR ‚Äì managed aquifer recharge ‚Äì where flood water is captured and used for recharge to recover from the last drought and prepare for the next.

Identifying an optimal site for groundwater recharge requires considering many factors, one of which is the subsurface geology. In the Central Valley of California, we are using InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) deformation images, derived from data acquired with the Sentinel-1 satellites, to identify locations where natural recharge is likely occurring.

We obtain information about subsurface materials, required to understand natural recharge and to support managed recharge, using data recently acquired with the airborne electromagnetic (EM) method and with a ground-based EM method. This integration of various forms of geophysical imaging is allowing us to map fast paths for recharge in California‚Äôs Central Valley.

292,aWeiV0PHrsI,NASA Climate Change,Cloud Physics from Space,"This talk describes a journey in the progression of cloud physics from a subdiscipline of meteorology into the global science it is today. The journey begins with important post-war contributions of four key individuals who were instrumental in developing cloud physics into a global science. These contributions came on the heels of the post-war weather modification efforts that influenced much of the early development of the science. Progress in the discipline of cloud physics offered by space-based measurements is also outlined.

How this progress is now shedding light on a number of challenges associated with projecting future climate change is described including the connection between the early contributions to cloud physics and the current vexing problem of aerosol effects on cloud albedo. The journey ends by looking to the future noting areas where progress might be expected in the coming decade.

294,AID17XeMiAY,NASA Climate Change,NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) Earth Venture Mission,"Several recent technological revolutions have converged to make possible a new paradigm in spaceborne Earth observations. One is the miniaturization of low power, high performance digital electronic systems, largely driven by commercial products like smart phones and laptops. Another is the rise of cubesats and their transition from educational student projects to highly capable, high reliability small satellites. The third revolution is one of perception. Until recently, major space organizations such as NASA, NOAA, DoD, ESA, and the private sector tended not to view smallsats as a serious part of the toolkit of technologies available to meet their core objectives. But that perception has changed. Not only are smallsats becoming a mainstream element of spaceborne technology, they are enabling new types of measurements and new science and applications that would not otherwise be possible. One example of this is the ability to resolve short time scale geophysical processes such as extreme weather events, made possible by placing large constellations of smallsats in low Earth orbit.

The CYGNSS constellation of eight microsatellites was successfully launched in December 2016 into a low inclination Earth orbit. Each satellite carries a bistatic radar receiver that measures signals transmitted by Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and scattered back into space from the surface. Over ocean, wind speed and air-sea heat flux are measured. Over land, measurements of soil moisture, flood inundation, wetland extent, and river width and slope are made. An overview and current status of the mission will be presented, together with highlights of recent science and applications results.

307,Soigh-wHw0k,NASA Climate Change,Methane Emissions in the United States,"Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. While emissions are substantially lower than for carbon dioxide, the biggest driver of climate change, methane is more efficient at trapping heat on a molecule by molecule basis. As a result, understanding the sources of methane and how they can be reduced, quickly, is a major effort of policymakers and environmental managers around the world.

This visualization presents methane emissions across the United States for the year 2012. It is designed to be consistent with the EPA‚Äôs 2016 Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks for the year 2012, which presents national totals for different source types. Estimates are produced using a wide range of databases at the state, county, local, and point source level.

Agriculture emissions in this visualization include manure management, enteric fermentation (the digestive process in animals such as cattle), rice cultivation, and field burning. Waste emissions include landfills, wastewater treatment, and composting. Natural Gas emissions include emissions from production, processing, and transmission. Coal emissions include both active and abandoned coal mines.

311,8CgG6C-yTBQ,NASA Climate Change,A Framework for Evaluating Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Information for Decision Making,"Climate change, driven by increases in human-produced greenhouse gases and particles (collectively referred to as GHGs), is the most serious environmental issue facing society. The need to reduce GHGs has become urgent as heat waves, heavy rain events, and other impacts of climate change have become more frequent and severe. Since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, more than 136 countries, accounting for about 80% of total global GHG emissions, have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. A growing number of cities, regional governments, and industries have also made pledges to reduce emissions. Providing decision makers with useful, accurate, and trusted GHG emissions information is a crucial part of this effort.

A National Academies fast-track consensus study was completed to develop a framework for evaluating global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) information to support decision making. The committee, which included Dr. Eldering, examined emerging approaches that supplement self-reported data with other independent data sources in the development and evaluation of global anthropogenic GHG emissions inventories. This study was conducted on an accelerated timeline in order to inform COP27 discussions in November 2022, and created in a framework for evaluating emissions inventories and information, and include several case studies for how such a framework could be applied in practice to specific sector- or country-based emission inventories.

This Distinguished Climate Lecture from the JPL Center for Climate Sciences will focus on the report recommendations and key insights.

About the Speaker:
Annmarie Eldering has over 30 years of experience in the fields of air pollution, greenhouse gases, and remote sensing. She retired from NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2022. Her early work at Caltech focused on measuring and modeling the aerosols that form in the Los Angeles Basin and drastically reduce visibility. Dr. Eldering developed advanced computer models to simulate these processes and evaluate possible strategies for emissions reductions and improvement in air quality. At the JPL, she was the Project Scientist on satellite projects to measure tropospheric air pollution (TES) and later carbon dioxide (the Orbiting Carbon Observatories (-2 and -3)). Through these satellite projects, she has worked closely with the modeling community that is combining ground-based measurements, emissions inventories, and satellite measurements in atmospheric models to create the most complete understanding of the carbon cycle and the state of Earth‚Äôs atmospheric composition including greenhouse gases. She was also a deputy section manager and section manager in Earth Atmospheric Science at JPL for 5 years, guiding and organizing a cohort of near 100 scientists, technical staff, and postdocs. Dr. Eldering received her B.E. in chemical engineering from Cooper Union and her Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering Science from Caltech.

313,5FU2DAREWbw,NASA Climate Change,Tracking 30 Years of Sea Level Rise,"Thirty years ago, scientists and engineers launched a new satellite to study the rising and falling of seas over time, a task that once could only be done from the coast. TOPEX/Poseidon rocketed into space on August 10, 1992, and started a 30-year record of ocean surface height around the world. The observations have confirmed on a global scale what scientists previously saw from the shoreline: the seas are rising, and the pace is quickening.

Scientists have found that global mean sea level‚Äîshown in the line plot above and below‚Äîhas risen 10.1 centimeters (3.98 inches) since 1993. Over the past 140 years, satellites and tide gauges together show that global sea level has risen 21 to 24 centimeters (8 to 9 inches). That's like covering the contiguous U.S. in about 16 feet (about 5 meters) of water. Recent rates have been unprecedented over the past 2,500-plus years.

314,KU2xslwLIKo,NASA Climate Change,"Towards a Worldwide Observing, Forecasting and Attribution System for Air Quality","Each year, 4 million people die prematurely in the world from outdoor air pollution, to a large extent in low- and middle-income countries. Actions must therefore be taken to improve air quality. Specifically, a major effort is required to implement the latest standards adopted by the World Health Organization.

In support of air quality mitigation, the scientific community has developed observational and modeling tools to measure chemical species using monitoring stations, aircraft-borne instrumentation and satellites, to provide air quality forecasts at the global, regional and local scales, and to project future trends in the chemical composition of the atmosphere. The ultimate goal is to develop attribution approaches that are required to identify the major sources of pollutants and to take appropriate actions that will improve public health.

The seminar will review progress in the development of these tools and will discuss strategic options needed to improve air quality on each continent. Changes in the world economy tend to generate new hot spots and areas of concern about poor air quality. The development of a global network of public and private institutions to address the air pollution question with similarities with the global weather monitoring system is therefore required. It must be complemented by an active dissemination program. Examples of efforts in this direction will be presented.

322,Q-Zsu1__tPU,NASA Climate Change,What NASA Knows from Decades of Earth System Observations,"NASA has the world‚Äôs largest Earth-observing fleet, with an uninterrupted record of observed evidence of climate change. Increased greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.

Trapped atmospheric greenhouse gases warm the planet ‚Äì our land, ocean, and atmosphere. Most of the global warming goes into the ocean, delaying the full impact of global warming. Ocean currents move the heat around the globe, impacting your local weather and climate. The warmer ocean accelerates melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.

Rising seas are a major consequence of climate change, impacting coastal communities, infrastructure, and the economy. A warmer climate amplifies Earth‚Äôs water cycle. Dry areas are getting drier, and wet areas are getting wetter. Wet areas are experiencing more flooding and extreme storms, such as typhoons and hurricanes. Drought-prone areas will see less rainfall, affecting agriculture.

NASA data are used for projections that can help inform actions for the future. More extreme conditions are occurring due to climate change, such as wildfires. NASA data and knowledge are open and free, enabling informed decision-making. The agency's information aids preparation and recovery from natural hazards around the world.

326,VbOF--Xgs8s,NASA Climate Change,Global Carbon Dioxide: 2020-2021,"This video shows the accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during a single calendar year. Every year, the world‚Äôs vegetation and ocean absorb about half of human-caused CO2 emissions, slowing the rate of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.

However, around 2.5 parts per million (ppm) remain in the atmosphere every year, causing a steady rise in concentrations that scientists have been tracking since the 1950s, at surface stations. (The term ""parts per million"" refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air.)

The visualization starts in June 2020, showing all of the model‚Äôs values of global CO2. (All 3D cells of the model are opaque, revealing a solid brick of data.) During this month, the higher values of CO2 coalesce around the ""equatorial belt.""

By mid-July 2020, CO2 values between 385 ppm and 405 ppm in the atmosphere become transparent. These lower values tend to be higher in the atmosphere. By visualizing the data like this, the higher CO2 concentrations, which are closer to the ground, are highlighted, revealing the seasonal movement of high CO2 at a global scale.

During the months of June to September (summer months in the Northern Hemisphere), global CO2 concentrations tend to be the lowest, because Northern Hemisphere plants actively absorb CO2 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis, which is the process of turning sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into food (sugars) and oxygen. During Northern Hemisphere fall and winter months, much of the CO2 is re-released into the atmosphere, due to respiration, and can be seen building up.

By June and July 2021, plants again draw CO2 out of the atmosphere, but notably higher amounts remain there in contrast with the previous year. The daily rhythm of CO2 is apparent over our planet's largest forests, such as the Amazon rainforest in South America and the Congo rainforest in Central Africa.

The fast-paced pulse in those rainforests is due to the day-night CO2 cycle: Plants absorb the greenhouse gas during the day via photosynthesis (when the sun is out), and then stop absorbing it at night.

In addition to highlighting the buildup of atmospheric CO2, the video shows how interconnected the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas problem is. NASA‚Äôs unique combination of observations and models plays a critical role in helping scientists track CO2 increases to better understand their climate impact.

327,BxrkI9Gamwk,NASA Climate Change,"So What if Warm, Moist Air Rises - Why Should We Care?","Convective storms form through the rising of warm, moist air deep within the atmosphere. These cloud systems significantly impact all life on Earth through the fresh water they provide and the severe weather they produce. They also play a fundamental role in the vertical transport and redistribution of atmospheric properties; assist in driving large-scale atmospheric circulation systems with implications for regional and global climates; and produce upper-level cirrus clouds which influence the magnitude and sign of cloud-radiative forcing. Despite the importance of convective storms, accurately representing these cloud systems in regional weather forecast models through global climate models remains extremely challenging, leaving us poorly prepared to predict and manage the impacts of convection in current and future climates. In this talk I will first describe the critical role played by convective storms in Earth‚Äôs weather and climate system. This will be followed by a discussion of some of the fundamental questions still facing the convection community and the challenges in addressing them. I will conclude with several suggestions as to what observations might enhance our theoretical understanding of convective processes and their representation within our regional and climate models.

334,9e9_EtYc9Zw,NASA Climate Change,Mass Change as a Designated Observable: Study Overview and Results,"Abstract:
The value of mass change observations for understanding the Earth system has been highlighted in multiple community reports. Including the 2007 Earth Science and Applications from Space (ESAS) Decadal Survey (DS) with the recommendation of a higher capability GRACE-II Tier-3 mission, 2010 NASA Climate-Centric Architecture report with the recommendation of GRACE Follow-On (2018-present) as a gap-filler mission to continue critical observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE; 2002-2017), and most recently in the 2017 ESAS DS in which Mass Change is listed as a Designated Observable. The Mass Change Designated Observable will ‚Äúensure continuity of measurements of groundwater and water storage mass change, land ice contributions to sea-level rise, ocean mass change, ocean heat content, glacial isostatic adjustment, and earthquake mass movement,‚Äù as summarized in the 2017 DS. In response to this designation, NASA initiated a multi-center study team led by JPL to study and recommend high-value observing systems for mass change that can be implemented within the next decade and are responsive to the DS science and applications objectives. This talk provides an overview of the study process and key findings. These include the creation of a community-vetted Science and Applications Traceability Matrix, the assessment via numerical simulations of the science value of over 50+ observing system variants, and the utilization of a value framework process that takes into account science value, cost, risk, technology readiness level, schedule, and international partnerships to discriminate between architectures. The study process has led to the identification of a small subset of high-value observing systems to move forward for more in-depth study in Pre-Phase A. Expected science outcomes from this small subset of architectures will be discussed in detail.

In late 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine finalized the report of the 2017-2027 decadal survey of Earth Science and Applications from Space. This was the second such Earth science survey and it converged to a final, small set of Science and Applications Priorities and Observing System Priorities starting from a large number of community-provided inputs. Emerging from these were a set of eight designated observables (DO‚Äôs) declared to be of highest priority for the decade. Observations of aerosol (A) and separately clouds, convection and precipitation (CCP) were recommended as two of these designated observables. Since the science of each significantly overlap the other, NASA proposed these be combined into a single (ACCP) DO study, now renamed AtmOS. This talk reviews the principal outcomes of the DO study that has now defined AtmOS, its architecture and the main elements of the AtmOS program.

(More information on the layers of Earth's atmosphere can be found here: https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/.)


Each world map and plot comes from a different data source, with white lines representing modern observations. The green lines represent natural drivers, red lines show human drivers, and blue lines illustrate both natural and human drivers ‚Äî all coming from climate model (simulation) outputs. As expected, the blue lines and white lines match because reliable modern observations (measurements of what actually happened) align with the total simulated data.


Clearly, human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels) dominate temperature increases at the surface (where humans live) and in the ocean.

338,K7z6mxe7ej4,NASA Climate Change,The GMAO High-Resolution Coupled Model and Assimilation System for Seasonal Prediction,"The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) is about to release a new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Subseasonal to Seasonal prediction (S2S) system, GEOS-S2S-3, that represents an improvement in performance and infrastructure over the previous system, GEOS-S2S-2. The system will be described, including some features unique to GEOS-S2S, and the advantages of increases in resolution, upgrades in the model, expansion of data used for assimilation, and the change in ensemble perturbation strategy and ensemble size will be demonstrated. Results are presented from forecasts, climate equillibrium simulations, and data assimilation experiments. GEOS-S2S-3 will be used to produce a long term weakly coupled reanalysis called MERRA-2 Ocean.

The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean shows a reduction in systematic error relative to GEOS-S2S-2, attributed in part to an increase in ocean resolution and to the upgrade in the glacier runoff scheme. The GEOS-S2S-3 coupled reanalysis also shows improvements attributed to the assimilation of satellite surface salinity. The forecast skill shows improved prediction of the North Atlantic Oscillation, attributed to the increase in forecast ensemble members.

With the release of GEOS-S2S-3 and MERRA-2 Ocean, GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state-of-the-art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.

ABOUT THE LECTURER: Dr. Andrea Molod is a Physical Research Scientist at the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. She has been leading the GMAO‚Äôs Seasonal Prediction system group since 2016, overseeing the development of the coupled model, the weakly coupled data assimilation system and the ensemble forecasting strategy. Her focus for development has been the expansion of the model‚Äôs interactive components towards a complete earth system, and the inclusion of new data types in the assimilation. Dr. Molod originally joined the predecessor of the GMAO in 1985, and her work until recently primarily focused on understanding and modeling the processes that occur near the land/ocean surface and in the boundary layer. An integral part of her work continues to be the assessment and improvement of a GCM‚Äôs ability to predict the evolution of the earth‚Äôs weather and climate from synoptic to seasonal scales, functioning in atmosphere-only, coupled ocean/atmosphere, and data assimilation modes.

339,0d1vBXEURNI,NASA Climate Change,"A Machine Learning Approach Toward a ‚ÄúSeamless‚Äù Understanding Droughts, Heatwaves and Fire Weather","The National Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC) aims to improve earth system prediction from sub-seasonal to decade scales, with emphasis on ‚Äúseamless‚Äù prediction. Yet, our understanding of weather-climate connection, especially in a changing climate, is still in its infancy. For example, it is not clear what weather patterns are responsible for dry spells and heat waves during the warm season over continental United States (US), and which of these patterns are responsible for extreme droughts and stronger and longer fire season? How do decadal climate variability and anthropogenic forced climate change affect the intensity and frequency of extreme fire weather?

In this lecture, I will report our recent and ongoing studies to explore these questions through machine learning approaches. To assess the influence of weather patterns on droughts and fire weather, we use multivariate Self-Organization Map to characterize the weather patterns responsible for dry and wet spells, their associated atmospheric thermodynamic condition and moisture transport, and their contributions to warm season droughts and decadal variability of the land surface aridity and fire weather. We also use a constructed flow analogue approach to determine the relative influence of natural climate variability and anthropogenic forced change on the increase of heatwaves and fire weather in recent decades over Western US, including those that contributed to the 2020 August Camp Fire, California‚Äôs largest wildfire on record.

The analyses suggest that, although many weather patterns can contribute to dry spells and moderate droughts, extreme droughts are largely caused by an increased frequency and persistence of a few leading weather patterns that are responsible for strong dry spells climatologically. Thus, understand the causes behind the changes of these few weather patterns is central for determining predictability of the extreme droughts. On the other hand, for the same weather patterns, the probability distributions of surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the recent decades have changed significantly over the western US, leading to higher probability of heatwaves and fire weather, compared to earlier decades. Consequently, at least two-thirds of the increase of the fire weather over western US during recent decades is attributable to climate change, whereas only one third or less of the increase of fire weather is attributable to changing weather patterns. Thus, climate variability and changes can have significant impact on weather and sub-seasonal forecasts.


ABOUT THE LECTURER: Dr. Rong Fu is a climate research and a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles. Her research focuses on the mechanisms that control droughts, rainfall seasonality and variability over Amazonian and North American regions, and how changes of global climate, local vegetation and biomass burning, and oceanic decadal variability have influenced these processes in the recent past and will influence rainfall seasonality and droughts in the future.

In this talk I will first discuss the role of thunderstorms in maintaining the global circuit. Some have argued that long term monitoring of the global circuit can yield information about climate change. Current theories for cloud electrification will then be summarized. Charge structures and lightning flash rates as measured by Very High Frequency (VHF) Lightning Mapping Arrays will be presented, leading to a discussion of how lightning is tied to cloud dynamical and microphysical processes. Finally, data from the new Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) will be discussed, in particular for so called ‚Äúelectrically inverted‚Äù storms.

COVID-19 related shutdowns have resulted in significant changes in anthropogenic emissions in 2020. We use estimates of COVID-19 mitigation related emissions changes in an Earth System Model to tease out COVID related impacts across timescales, starting with impacts of aviation reductions on daily weather and climate, to local and global air quality and composition impacts of regional and global emissions changes, to the direct and indirect radiative forcing associated with emissions changes. Using a hierarchy of model approaches we are able to separate signal to noise, and show small but quantifiable impacts on the earth system, equivalent to rolling back up to a decade worth of emissions increases. And finally, there are some interesting similarities between models of climate and pandemics, and how we understand uncertainty in models.

342,TctFCL0fDLk,NASA Climate Change,Ocean imprints: Small-scale air-sea interactions and ocean-weather climate connections,"The transfer of energy between the ocean and atmosphere drives global weather patterns and climate variability, as the ocean contains close to 97% of Earth‚Äôs water and has absorbed more than 90% of the excess heating in the Earth system. These air-sea interactions are critical to large-scale weather and climate predictions because of the ocean‚Äôs ability to absorb the excess atmospheric heat and carbon and regulate exchanges of momentum, water vapor and heat between the ocean and atmosphere. In this talk I will discuss how the ocean impacts our weather and climate systems, and what we do and don‚Äôt know about our air-sea interactions, with a focus on the impact of largely upsampled small-scale variability. I will also talk about what changes we have seen in the last few decades, and discuss how these changes are affecting water moving through the ocean, atmosphere, land and back again. There are still gaps in our knowledge of this complicated part of our climate system, and we will talk about unknowns and new observations, models, and forecasts that are being developed to help us improve predictability for weather and climate information.

350,AmSovbt5Bho,NASA Climate Change,Antarctic Ice Mass Loss 2002-2020,"The Antarctic ice sheet's mass has changed over the last decades. Research based on satellite data indicates that between 2002 and 2020, Antarctica shed approximately 150 billion metric tons of ice per year, adding to global sea level rise.

These images, created from GRACE and GRACE-FO data, show changes in Antarctic ice mass since 2002. Orange and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002.

Areas in East Antarctica experienced modest amounts of mass gain due to increased snow accumulation. However, this gain is more than offset by significant ice mass loss on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (dark red) over the 19-year period. Floating ice shelves whose mass change GRACE and GRACE-FO do not measure are colored gray.

The average flow lines (gray; created from satellite radar interferometry) of Antarctica‚Äôs ice converge into the locations of prominent outlet glaciers, and coincide with areas of highest mass loss (i.e., Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West-Antarctica). This supports other observations that warming ocean waters around Antarctica play a key role in contemporary ice mass loss.

In general, higher-elevation areas near the center of Greenland experienced little to no change, while lower-elevation and coastal areas experienced over 16.4 feet (5 meters) of ice mass loss (expressed in equivalent-water-height; dark red) over this 19-year period. The largest mass decreases occurred along the West Greenland coast.

356,PSJRymZ5bJs,NASA Climate Change,Global Ocean Tides,"Ocean tides are not simple. If our planet had no continents, tides would be hemispheric-sized bulges of water moving westward with the moon and sun. This animation shows the tides as a complex system of rotating and trapped waves with a mixture of frequencies. Waves run relatively unimpeded westward only around Antarctica. Even there, we see a complicated pattern as waves merge from the north and others separate northwards or southwards under Antarctic ice shelves.

In the North Atlantic, we see waves mainly rotating anti-clockwise, with small amplitudes in the middle of the ocean and high amplitudes around the boundaries, especially along the coasts of northwest Europe and Britain. Waves are trapped and rotating around New Zealand, causing a high tide on one side of the islands with a simultaneous low tide on the other side.

The Topex/Poseidon and Jason satellite altimeter missions were designed to observe and record this complexity. Altimeters on these missions acted as flying tide gauges. After several years collecting data, researchers could analyze the signals at each ocean location to determine the tidal characteristics. With that knowledge, plus near-perfect knowledge of the motion of the sun and moon, the tide can be predicted at any location and at any time in the future.

The data used in this visualization run for slightly longer than one Earth day. The level of the tides is exaggerated in order to show how the tides vary around the world.

358,OfMsX2ZHABM,NASA Climate Change,"Ocean Flows Under Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica","Glaciers surrounding the Amundsen Sea in Antarctica have been rapidly melting. As glaciers flow out from land to the ocean, large expanses of ice behind their leading edges float on the seawater. The point on a glacier where it first loses contact with land is called the grounding line. Nearly all glacier melt occurs on the underside of the glacier beyond the grounding line, on the section floating on seawater as the warmer ocean currents erode the base of the floating ice.

This visualization shows ocean currents circulating Pine Island Bay and flowing under Pine Island Glacier. The visualization approaches the glacier, dives beneath the water, and views the ocean flows circulating beneath the floating ice. For more clarity, the surface of the ice sheet is exaggerated by 4x while the topography below sea level is exaggerated by 15x.

359,Vv6DOLdWWRM,NASA Climate Change,Understanding the Warming Arctic,"While the representation of physical processes in climate models has become more sophisticated over the last 30+ years, the vertical and seasonal fingerprints of Arctic greenhouse warming have not changed. Are the models right? Observations in recent decades show the same fingerprints: surface amplified warming especially in late fall and winter. Recent observations show no summer cloud response to Arctic sea ice loss, but increased cloud cover and a deepening atmospheric boundary layer in fall. Taken together, clouds appear to not affect the fingerprints of Arctic warming. The interconnected positive surface albedo feedback and positive lapse rate feedback rule. Can we check the models? Having observations alone does not enable robust model evaluation and model improvement. Comparing models and observations is hard enough but to improve models, one must make credible comparisons, understand why models and observations differ, and improve the physics. It‚Äôs all a tall order, but recent progress is summarized here.

360,q7OfMoMxkYg,NASA Climate Change,Is cloud dynamics impossibly complex or fundamentally simple?,"In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson posed the dream of using a grid of prognostic equations to accurately compute future weather before it arrives. But while weather predictability has been realized, and despite tremendous improvements in computational speed and physical understanding, we have been less successful at constraining the future role of clouds in climate. The general scientific strategy for tackling the problem has been to model clouds using Richardson‚Äôs deterministic concept for weather. But does this make the most sense? I will discuss an alternative time-independent approach where, statistically speaking, the complex geometries of tropical convective cloud fields can be seen to ‚Äúemerge‚Äù from a point value of the bulk tropospheric stability. Circulations around cloud edge compete with each other for total buoyant energy and air, and this constrains both total cloud amount and the distributions of cloud sizes. Theoretical predictions are in close agreement with a detailed LES tropical cloud field simulation of one billion grid points, and with Oxygen A-band satellite retrievals over the tropics. Possible implications for cloud distributions and cover in a warmer climate will be explored.

The presentation will then focus on the important discoveries, in the past decade or so, of how oceanic surface heterogeneity at the eddy scale imprints itself on the atmosphere. This leads to slowly-evolving spatial modulations of surface buoyancy and momentum fluxes that generate ""secondary circulations"" in both media near the air-sea interface, with net climate effects both in oceanic eddy energy level and, potentially, in marine cloud pattern formation.

The visualization presented here shows the complex patterns of methane emissions produced globally between January 2018 and November 2018 from different sources.

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that traps heat 28 times more effectively than carbon dioxide over a 100-year timescale. Concentrations of methane have increased by more than 150% since industrial activities and intensive agriculture began. After carbon dioxide, methane was responsible for about 23% of climate change in the 20th century.

Methane is produced under conditions where little to no oxygen is available. About 30% of methane emissions are produced by wetlands, including ponds, lakes, and rivers. Another 20% is produced by agriculture, due to a combination of livestock, waste management and rice cultivation. Activities related to oil, gas, and coal extraction release an additional 30%.

The remainder of methane emissions come from minor sources such as wildfire, biomass burning, permafrost, termites, dams, and the ocean. Scientists around the world are working to better understand the budget of methane with the ultimate goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving prediction of environmental change. For additional information, see the Global Methane Budget: https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/methanebudget/index.htm and NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4799.

With a collection of advanced sensors, PACE will study ocean color, aerosols, clouds, climate change, and other aspects of Earth's overall health. The backbone of the mission is the satellite itself, providing data to a robust network of scientists in a wide range of disciplines.


In the Spring of 2020, the physical construction of the PACE spacecraft moved into high gear, with engineers working hard to build, assemble, and test the actual machine. When the global COVID-19 pandemic forced social distancing among the development teams, the challenge was how to keep making progress on this extremely important research initiative, even though most engineers and others involved with the mission's development could not actually work together in fabrication areas.


It turns out that the extraordinary team bring PACE to life were not about to give up their goals, and in this video, we hear from a range of NASA pros talk about how to keep going, keep standards high, and see their plans through even the most challenging of circumstances.

371,8NhWLBdXC4U,NASA Climate Change,COVID-19 Mitigation Leads to Reduced Pollution Associated with Decreased Fossil Fuel Use,"Over the past several weeks, the United States has seen significant reductions in air pollution over its major metropolitan areas. Similar reductions in air pollution have been observed in other regions of the world. These recent improvements in air quality have come at a high cost, as communities grapple with widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders as a result of the spread of COVID-19.

One air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels (diesel, gasoline, coal), coming out of our tailpipes when driving cars and smokestacks when generating electricity. Therefore, changes in NO2 levels can be used as an indicator of changes in human activity.

Sea surface temperature (water temperature at the sea's surface, where the ocean is in direct contact with the atmosphere) plays a large role in climate and weather. For example, every 3 to 7 years, a swath of the Pacific Ocean along the equator warms by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit). This warming is a hallmark of the climate pattern El Ni√±o, which changes rainfall patterns around the globe, causing heavy rainfall in the southern United States and severe drought in Australia, Indonesia and southern Asia.

On a smaller scale, ocean temperatures influence the development of tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons), which draw energy from warm ocean waters to form and intensify.

The results provide insights into how the polar ice sheets are changing, demonstrating definitively that small gains of ice in East Antarctica are dwarfed by massive losses in West Antarctica. The scientists found the net loss of ice from Antarctica, along with Greenland‚Äôs shrinking ice sheet, has been responsible for 0.55 inches (14 millimeters) of sea level rise between 2003 and 2019 ‚Äì slightly less than a third of the total amount of sea level rise observed in the world‚Äôs oceans.

378,54ECqX2tq9k,NASA Climate Change,NASA Models the Complex Chemistry of Earth's Atmosphere,"Air pollution can appear as a gray or orange haze enveloping a city. What the naked eye can‚Äôt see are the hundreds of chemical reactions taking place to produce that pollution. NASA science can reveal a more complete picture of atmospheric chemistry.

A NASA visualization shows 96 chemical species that help form one common air pollutant ‚Äî surface ozone. While ozone in the stratosphere is critical to maintaining life on earth, surface ozone is a toxic gas to most plant and animal species. This visualization uses the GEOS Composition Forecasting (GEOS-CF) computer model, which incorporates 240 chemical species and how they interact with each other and the weather through over 700 chemical reactions. All of these chemical reactions directly or indirectly impact the formation of ozone.

Capturing such complexity requires satellites, the GEOS-CF model, and a supercomputer all working in concert. As the visualization progresses, it cycles through chemicals loosely grouped into seven ‚Äòfamilies‚Äô based on their physical and chemical properties:
‚Ä¢ Ox
‚Ä¢ Extended HOx family
‚Ä¢ Hydrocarbons
‚Ä¢ Isoprene oxidation
‚Ä¢ Aerosols
‚Ä¢ Halogens
‚Ä¢ Extended NOx family

More information on each family can be found on the visualization webpage: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4754.

The dynamic behavior of some of these chemical species can indicate certain events in the atmosphere. The model covers the time period from July 22, 2018 to October 2, 2018, which includes several notable atmospheric events. Both the Carr Fire and the Mendocino Complex Fire, occurring in late July 2018, released a large amount of hydrocarbons and extended HOx, which can be seen in the model. The latter-occurring Hurricane Florence is also visible, as indicated by the impacted halogens in this atmospheric model.

Satellites observe chemical species in the atmosphere, both those emitted from natural and human sources and those formed from other pollutants. Yet, even several hundred thousand observations a day leave data gaps. Merging satellite data with NASA‚Äôs GEOS-CF model yields not only a snapshot of chemistry throughout the atmosphere at any given time but also the ability to predict air quality worldwide.

This model makes a 5-day forecast daily using the NASA Center for Climate Simulation‚Äôs Discover supercomputer: https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/. Developed jointly with several government and non-profit partners, these forecasts offer a new tool for academic researchers, government scientists, air quality managers, and the general public. Potential applications include flight campaign planning, support of satellite observations, and mitigation of air pollution.

Heavy rainfall, river outflows, ocean currents, sea ice melt, evaporation and other seasonal phenomena can all alter salinity‚Äîand scientists can now see these changes in clear detail.

NASA's Aquarius mission has collected the agency's first full year of satellite ocean surface salinity measurements, revealing a colorful and dynamic portrait of our salty seas.

Salinity shifts, a powerful driver of global ocean currents, are also a fingerprint of variations in Earth's fresh water cycle, providing valuable information on how a changing climate is altering global rainfall patterns.

Before Aquarius, researchers had only snapshots of the ocean's salt content variations. With global satellite measurements, they will now be able to see how salinity changes over time. Watch the video to learn more about our ocean's salty motions.

The local impacts of the Australian bushfires have been devastating to property and life in Australia, while producing extreme air quality impacts throughout the region.

As smoke from the massive fires has interacted with global weather, the transport of smoke plumes around the globe has accelerated into the upper troposphere and even the lowermost stratosphere, leading to long-range transport around the globe.

The smoke from these bushfires will travel across the Southern Ocean, completing a global circumnavigation back around to Australia, and is particularly pronounced across the southern Pacific Ocean out to South America.

The Arctic sea ice cap is an expanse of frozen seawater floating on top of the Arctic Ocean and neighboring seas. Every year, it expands and thickens during the fall and winter and grows smaller and thinner during the spring and summer.

But in the past decades, increasing temperatures have caused marked decreases in the Arctic sea ice extents in all seasons, with particularly rapid reductions in the minimum end-of-summer ice extent. The shrinking of the Arctic sea ice cover can ultimately affect local ecosystems, global weather patterns, and the circulation of the oceans.

402,fNBkqOmdT4g,NASA Climate Change,Methane in the Climate System: Monitoring Emissions from Satellites,"The climate forcing from methane emissions since pre-industrial times has been 60% of that from CO2, meaning that methane has made a large contribution to observed warming over the past century. However, the climate impact of methane emissions is very different than that of CO2 emissions in terms of time scales, and this must be recognized when setting climate policy targets: use of a single climate metric to compare the effects of methane and CO2 emissions is not appropriate. An additional complication is that methane is emitted by a variety of sources, and there is large uncertainty in the contribution of different source regions and sectors to the overall methane budget. The recent decadal uptick in methane has generated much interest and is still unexplained. Satellites offer considerable potential for global monitoring of methane emissions, quantifying the contributions from different sources, detecting temporal variability, and attributing long-term trends. Atmospheric methane has been measured continuously from space since 2003, and new instruments have been recently launched or are planned for launch in the near future that will greatly expand the capabilities of space-based observations. I will discuss the value of these observations to better quantify and monitor methane emissions, from the global scale down to the scale of point sources.

Snow and glaciers in these mountains contain the largest volume of freshwater outside of Earth's polar ice sheets, leading hydrologists to nickname this region the Third Pole. 

Rapid changes in the region's climate are affecting glacier flows and snowmelt. Local people are already modifying their land-use practices in response to the changing supply, and the region's ecology is transforming. Scientists estimate that by 2100, these glaciers could be up to 75% smaller in volume. 

NASA's satellites observe and measure snow and ice cover remotely with multiple types of sensors. This allows scientists to create an authoritative estimate of the water budget of this region and a set of products local policy makers can use in responding to hazards and planning for a changing water supply.

409,QtUmj5z2vCk,NASA Climate Change,Modeling the Future of the Greenland Ice Sheet,"Scientists at the University of Alaska Fairbanks‚Äô Geophysical Institute used data from NASA‚Äôs Operation IceBridge to develop a more accurate model of how the Greenland Ice Sheet might respond to climate change in the future, finding that it could generate more sea level rise than previously thought.

In the next 50 years, the model shows that melting at the present rate could contribute one to four inches to global sea level rise. This number jumps to five to13 inches by 2100 and 19 to 63 inches by 2200. These numbers are considerably higher than previous estimates, which forecasted up to 35 inches of sea level rise by 2200.

The updated model is the first to include outlet glaciers ‚Äî river-like bodies of ice that connect to the ocean. Outlet glaciers play a key role in how ice sheets melt, but previous models lacked the data to adequately represent their complex flow patterns. The study found that melting outlet glaciers could account for up to 40% of the ice mass lost from Greenland in the next 200 years.

By incorporating ice thickness data from IceBridge and identifying sources of statistical uncertainty within the model, the study creates a more accurate picture of how human-generated greenhouse gas emissions and a warming climate may affect Greenland in the future.

In 2003, Randerson moved to UC Irvine where he now holds the position of Ralph J. and Carol M. Cicerone Professor of Earth System Science.

Carbon cycle feedbacks have the potential to accelerate the build up of atmospheric carbon dioxide, making it more difficult to stabilize the climate system. In his talk, Professor Randerson will describe several terrestrial carbon cycle feedback mechanisms involving lightning, wildfires and sea level rise that are likely to become increasingly important over a period of decades to centuries. Within the oceans, Professor Randerson will discuss how changes in sea ice cover around Antarctica may trigger sustained losses of global ocean productivity and fisheries for more than a millennium.

interests are in tropical weather and climate variability, understanding their influence on the global climate system and their role in monthly to decadal climate prediction.

Climate change will be one of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century; how we respond will determine our future prosperity, health and well-being and the sustainability of Earth‚Äôs natural environment. However, these responses must be underpinned by the best possible climate science to ensure that we make wise decisions on how to build resilience to weather and climate extremes, and adapt to and mitigate climate change.

413,MwDzXed8JEQ,NASA Climate Change,Severe Thunderstorms and Climate ‚Äì a JPL Center for Climate Sciences Presentation,"Severe thunderstorms, which are often associated with strong winds, hail, and tornadoes, pose substantial threats to people, livestock, and agriculture. While their dynamics are well understood, relatively little is known about how climate change (man‚Äêmade or natural) might affect such storms. In this talk I will focus on one of the main environmental prerequisites for severe storms: Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), which is a measure of the potential energy stored in moist atmospheres that can be released explosively when the potential energy barrier that permits its accumulation breaks. I will discuss the work of my former PhD student that shows, rather unexpectedly, that CAPE usually accumulates over only the 6‚Äê8 hours leading up to the storm and that its build‚Äêup is strongly controlled by soil moisture. I will present observational evidence for this as well as a very simple theoretical model, and discuss how climate change should affect CAPE and how the new understanding of CAPE may someday allow for seasonal prediction of severe storm activity.

The study, published in the journal Nature, compared predicted and real-world soil moisture data to look for human influences on global drought patterns in the 20th century. Climate models predict that a human ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù ‚Äì a global pattern of regional drying and wetting characteristic of the climate response to greenhouse gases ‚Äì should be visible early in the 1900‚Äôs and increase over time as emissions increased. Using observational data such as precipitation and historical data reconstructed from tree rings, the researchers found that the real-world data began to align with the fingerprint within the first half of the 20th century. 

The team said the study is the first to provide historical evidence connecting human-generated emissions and drought at near-global scales, lending credibility to forward-looking models that predict such a connection. According to the new research, the fingerprint is likely to grow stronger over the next few decades, potentially leading to severe human consequences.

However, Antarctica‚Äôs additional ice mass gained from snowfall only makes up for about a third of its current ice loss.

These findings don‚Äôt necessarily mean that Antarctica is growing; it‚Äôs still losing mass, even with the extra snowfall.

However, without these gains, the planet would have experienced even more sea level rise in the 20th century.

The polar ice sheets grow via snow accumulation and shrink through melting and the production of icebergs.

Presently, both ice sheets are imbalanced ‚Äì losing more ice annually than they are gaining ‚Äì and their ice loss is estimated to be currently causing about a half of the observed sea level rise.

Video transcript:
What's the difference between weather and climate?
Take a look outside your window.
Is it hot and sunny?
Is it cloudy and rainy?
Is there snow on the ground?
When you look out the window, you‚Äôre seeing what the weather is like today.
Weather is only temporary. For example, a blizzard can turn into a flood after just a few warm spring days.
Climate, on the other hand, is more than just a few warm or cool days.
Climate describes the typical weather conditions in an entire region for a very long time‚Äî30 years or more.
Keeping an eye on changing weather can help us plan ahead.
We know that if thunderclouds are forming overhead, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to stay inside.
But it‚Äôs important to keep an eye on changes in Earth‚Äôs climate, too. And NASA has observed that Earth is getting warmer.
Keeping track of Earth‚Äôs sea level is one way that we can know how quickly the climate is changing.
As Earth‚Äôs climate warms, ice in Antarctica and Greenland is melting. This causes the level of the oceans to rise.
NASA satellites can measure sea level rise from space.
They can also track changes in the climate by measuring the clouds.
We know that changes in the number, size or location of clouds could be caused by a change in Earth‚Äôs climate.
NASA satellites are always orbiting Earth, looking down at our oceans and clouds. And they monitor Earth‚Äôs climate in other ways, too.
It‚Äôs important to keep an eye on our planet and all the ways that it‚Äôs changing. Right now, it‚Äôs the only one we‚Äôve got!

As Earth's climate continues to warm, that carbon has begun to leach into the atmosphere, the result of microbes waking up and digesting once-frozen organic materials. 

A new NASA-funded study focuses on a mechanism that could accelerate the release of this atmospheric carbon, the result of thermokarst lakes. These lakes form when thawing permafrost causes the ground to slump, creating a depression that collects rain and snowmelt and perpetuates a cycle of further permafrost thaw.

Ocean circulation at the Antarctic margins is dominated by a system of circumpolar frontal currents that occupy the continental shelf and slope.  This Antarctic Slope Frontal (ASF) system has a significant impact on global climate through its control over the transport of warm water towards Antarctica's floating ice shelves and over the properties of bottom waters exported from the Antarctic shelf.  In the past two decades, appreciation of the spatial and temporal variability of the ASF and its impact on heat and tracer transport has grown through a combination of novel in situ observational techniques, remote sensing and high-resolution numerical modeling.  This talk will highlight how these different approaches have improved our dynamical understanding of the ASF and its role in the global circulation and climate system.

439,Z_9WbrPCMbc,NASA Climate Change,NASA studies an unusual Arctic warming event,"Winter temperatures are soaring in the Arctic for the fourth winter in a row. The heat, accompanied by moist air, is entering the Arctic not only through the sector of the North Atlantic Ocean that lies between Greenland and Europe, as it has done in previous years, but is also coming from the North Pacific through the Bering Strait.

‚ÄúWe have seen winter warming events before, but they‚Äôre becoming more frequent and more intense,‚Äù said Alek Petty, a sea ice researcher at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Scientists are waiting to see how much this heat wave will impact the wintertime sea ice maximum extent, which has been shrinking in the past decades and has hit record lows each of the past three years. The sea ice levels are already at record lows or near-record lows in several areas of the Arctic. Another exceptional event this winter is the opening up of the sea ice cover north of Greenland, releasing heat from the ocean to the atmosphere and making the sea ice more vulnerable to further melting.

‚ÄúThis is a region where we have the thickest multi-year sea ice and expect it to not be mobile, to be resilient,‚Äù Petty said. ‚ÄúBut now this ice is moving pretty quickly, pushed by strong southerly winds and probably affected by the warm temperatures, too.‚Äù

Continuing the planet‚Äôs long-term warming trend, globally averaged temperatures in 2017 were 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.90 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1951 to 1980 mean, according to scientists at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. That is second only to global temperatures in 2016. Last year was the third consecutive year in which temperatures were more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) above late nineteenth-century levels.

NASA‚Äôs temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from 6,300 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. 

These raw measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heating effects that could skew the conclusions. These calculations produce the global average temperature deviations from the baseline period of 1951 to 1980.

The full 2017 surface temperature data set and the complete methodology used to make the temperature calculation are available at http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/.

447,U5TyVrko-Ck,NASA Climate Change,Arctic sea ice from March to September 2017,"Arctic sea ice appears to have reached a record low wintertime maximum extent for 2017, according to scientists at the NASA-supported National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colo. Observations indicate that on September 13th, ice extent shrunk to the eighth lowest in the satellite record, at 4.64 million sq km, or 1.79 million sq mi.

In this visualization, the daily Arctic sea ice and seasonal land cover change progress through time, from this year‚Äôs wintertime maximum extent on March 7, 2017, through September 13, 2017 when the sea ice reached its annual minimum extent for the year. Over the water, Arctic sea ice changes from day to day showing a running 3-day minimum sea ice concentration in the region where the concentration is greater than 15%. The blueish white color of the sea ice is derived from a 3-day running minimum of the AMSR2 89 GHz brightness temperature. Over the terrain, monthly data from the seasonal Blue Marble Next Generation fades slowly from month to month.

448,7beEn6M4x3k,NASA Climate Change,NASA | Perpetual ocean,"Driven by wind and other forces, currents on the ocean surface cover our planet. Some span hundreds to thousands of miles across vast ocean basins in well-defined flows. Others are confined to particular regions and form slow-moving, circular pools. Seen from space, the circulating waters offer a study in both chaos and order. This visualization, based on ocean temperature, salinity, sea surface height and sea ice data collected during field observations and by NASA satellites between July 2005 and December 2007, highlights many of the world's most important ocean surface currents. Watch powerful, fast-moving currents like the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean and the Kuroshio in the Pacific Ocean carry warm waters northeastward at speeds greater than 4 mph. View coastal currents such as the Agulhas in the Southern Hemisphere transporting equatorial waters from the Indian Ocean farther southwards. Explore the image collection to compare the direction and unique flow pattern of each of these major currents.

451,zauJQzti7FQ,NASA Climate Change,Ocean circulation plays an important role in absorbing carbon from the atmosphere,"The oceans play a significant role in absorbing greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, and heat from the atmosphere. This absorption can help mitigate the early effects of human-emissions of carbon dioxide.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation acts as a conveyor belt of ocean water from Florida to Greenland. Along the journey north, water near the surface absorbs greenhouse gases, which sink down as the water cools near Greenland. In this way, the ocean effectively buries the gases deep below the surface.

Research based on observations from NASA‚Äôs twin NASA/German Aerospace Center‚Äôs twin Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites indicates that between 2002 and 2016, Antarctica shed approximately 125 gigatons of ice per year, causing global sea level to rise by 0.35 millimeters per year.

These images, created with GRACE data, show changes in Antarctic ice mass since 2002. Orange and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002. In general, areas near the center of Antarctica experienced small amounts of positive or negative change, while the West Antarctic Ice Sheet experienced a significant ice mass loss (dark red) over the fourteen-year period. Floating ice shelves whose mass GRACE doesn't measure are colored gray.

454,aWqjqLFmQnA,NASA Climate Change,Seasonal changes in carbon dioxide,"Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere through human activities. It is also influenced by natural exchange with the land and ocean. This visualization provides a high-resolution, three-dimensional view of global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015. The visualization was created using output from the GEOS modeling system, developed and maintained by scientists at NASA. The height of Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and topography have been vertically exaggerated and appear approximately 400 times higher than normal to show the complexity of the atmospheric flow. Measurements of carbon dioxide from NASA‚Äôs second Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) spacecraft are incorporated into the model every 6 hours to update, or ‚Äúcorrect,‚Äù the model results, called data assimilation.

As the visualization shows, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can be mixed and transported by winds in the blink of an eye. For several decades, scientists have measured carbon dioxide at remote surface locations and occasionally from aircraft. The OCO-2 mission represents an important advance in the ability to observe atmospheric carbon dioxide. OCO-2 collects high-precision, total column measurements of carbon dioxide (from the sensor to Earth‚Äôs surface) during daylight conditions. While surface, aircraft, and satellite observations all provide valuable information about carbon dioxide, these measurements do not tell us the amount of carbon dioxide at specific heights throughout the atmosphere or how it is moving across countries and continents. Numerical modeling and data assimilation capabilities allow scientists to combine different types of measurements (e.g., carbon dioxide and wind measurements) from various sources (e.g., satellites, aircraft, and ground-based observation sites) to study how carbon dioxide behaves in the atmosphere and how mountains and weather patterns influence the flow of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Scientists can also use model results to understand and predict where carbon dioxide is being emitted and removed from the atmosphere and how much is from natural processes and human activities.

Carbon dioxide variations are largely controlled by fossil fuel emissions and seasonal fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere and land biosphere. For example, dark red and orange shades represent regions where carbon dioxide concentrations are enhanced by carbon sources. During Northern Hemisphere fall and winter, when trees and plants begin to lose their leaves and decay, carbon dioxide is released in the atmosphere, mixing with emissions from human sources. This, combined with fewer trees and plants removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, allows concentrations to climb all winter, reaching a peak by early spring. During Northern Hemisphere spring and summer months, plants absorb a substantial amount of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, thus removing it from the atmosphere and change the color to blue (low carbon dioxide concentrations). This three-dimensional view also shows the impact of fires in South America and Africa, which occur with a regular seasonal cycle. Carbon dioxide from fires can be transported over large distances, but the path is strongly influenced by large mountain ranges like the Andes. Near the top of the atmosphere, the blue color indicates air that last touched the Earth more than a year before. In this part of the atmosphere, called the stratosphere, carbon dioxide concentrations are lower because they haven‚Äôt been influenced by recent increases in emissions.

This version of the visualization was created specifically to support a series of papers in the journal Science and for submission to SIGGRAPH 2017's Computer Animation Festival.

This visualization won Science magazine's 2017 Data Stories contest in the ""professional"" category (see: http://www.sciencemag.org/projects/data-stories/winners/2017).

With imagery and data from Landsat 8, a joint mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, scientists are providing a near-real-time view of every large glacier and ice sheet on Earth. Researchers aim to better understand how ice flow is changing worldwide by integrating information about atmosphere and ocean conditions to determine what causes these ice sheets to change ‚Äî and what that means for how much ice is flowing into the ocean. That could help provide critical information to coastal communities that will be most impacted by sea level rise.

463,8auMIfF50Ng,NASA Climate Change,Weekly Arctic sea ice age between 1984 and 2016,"One significant change in the Arctic region in recent years has been the rapid decline in perennial sea ice. Perennial sea ice, also known as multi-year ice, is the portion of the sea ice that survives the summer melt season. Perennial ice may have a life-span of nine years or more and represents the thickest component of the sea ice; perennial ice can grow up to 4 meters thick. By contrast, first year ice that grows during a single winter is generally at most 2 meters thick.

Below is an animation of the weekly sea ice age between 1984 and 2016. The animation shows the seasonal variability of the ice, growing in the Arctic winter and melting in the summer. In addition, this also shows the changes from year to year, depicting the age of the sea ice in different colors. Younger sea ice, or first-year ice, is shown in a dark shade of blue, while the ice that is at least four years old is shown as white. A color scale identifies the age of the intermediary years.

A graph in the lower right corner quantifies the change over time by showing the area in millions of square kilometers covered by each age category of perennial sea ice. This graph also includes a memory bar ‚Äî the green line that represents the current maximum value seen thus far in the animation for the particular week displayed.

Windblown dust, sea salts, sulfates, smoke from wildfires and pollution from factories are all examples of aerosols. Depending upon their size, type and location, aerosols can either cool the Earth's surface or warm it. They can help clouds form or inhibit cloud formation. And if inhaled, some aerosols can be harmful to people‚Äôs health.

To study aerosols and their impact on clouds, researchers from NASA‚Äôs Global Modeling and Assimilation Office ran a simulation of the atmosphere that captured how winds transport aerosols around the world. This simulation, produced by the Goddard Earth Observing System Model Version 5 (GEOS -5), shows clouds (white), dust (brown shades), sulfates (purple shades) and organic black carbon (green shades) at 7-kilometer resolution from September 1, 2005, to December 31, 2005 (hourly). Simulations like this allow scientists to better understand how different types of aerosols travel in the atmosphere, impact cloud formation and influence weather and climate.

Major changes in water mass can cause localized bumps and dips in gravity, sometimes with counterintuitive effects. Melting glaciers, for example, actually cause nearby sea level to drop; as they lose mass, their gravitational pull slackens, and sea water migrates away. In this animation, computed from data gathered by the twin GRACE satellites between April 2002 and March 2015, sea level is dropping around rapidly melting Greenland (orange, yellow).

Darker areas over land indicate higher population densities. Sea level scenarios are shown starting with 0 meters of sea level rise (current sea level) and proceeding through 9 meters of rise. Blue areas moving inland indicate where the coastline would be at various levels.

We will likely see some sea level rise in our lifetimes, but the middle-to-higher levels in this visualization are unlikely in the next 100 years.

This visualization is based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. This data primarily measured canopy heights. So, this visualization is showing where water might reach the tops of the trees in various areas.

496,DXogQ22x0X0,NASA Climate Change,West Antarctic Collapse (non-narrated),"A new study by researchers at NASA and the University of California, Irvine, finds a rapidly melting section of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appears to be in an irreversible state of decline, with nothing to stop the glaciers in this area from melting into the sea according to glaciologist and lead author Eric Rignot, of UC Irvine and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Three major lines of evidence point to the glaciers' eventual demise: the changes in their flow speeds, how much of each glacier floats on seawater, and the slope and depth of the terrain they are flowing over. In a paper in April, Rignot's research group discussed the steadily increasing flow speeds of these glaciers over the past 40 years. This new study examines the other two lines of evidence.

As glaciers flow out from land to the ocean, large expanses of ice behind their leading edges float on the seawater. The point on a glacier where it first loses contact with land is called the grounding line. Nearly all glacier melt occurs on the underside of the glacier beyond the grounding line, on the section floating on seawater. The Antarctic glaciers studied have thinned so much they are now floating above places where they used to sit solidly on land, which means their grounding lines are retreating inland.

497,W1BxGMgfgm8,NASA Climate Change,"Melting ice, rising seas","Sea level rise is an indicator that our planet is warming. Much of the world's population lives on or near the coast, and rising seas are something worth watching. Sea level can rise for two reasons, both linked to a warming planet. When ice on land, such as mountain glaciers or the ice sheets of Greenland or Antarctica, melt, that water contributes to sea level rise. And when our oceans get warmer - another indicator of climate change - the water expands, also making sea level higher. Using satellites, lasers, and radar in space, and dedicated researchers on the ground, NASA is studying the Earth's ice and water to better understand how sea level rise might affect us all.

512,Z3tZwbxRMGQ,NASA Climate Change,Greenland ice flow,"Greenland looks like a big pile of snow seen from space using a regular camera. But satellite radar interferometry helps us detect the motion of ice beneath the snow. Ice starts flowing from the flanks of topographic divides in the interior of the island, and increases in speed toward the coastline where it is channelized along a set of narrow, powerful outlet glaciers. In the east, these glaciers make their sinuous way through complex terrain at low speed. They form long floating extensions that deform slowly in the cold north. As we move toward sectors of higher snowfall in the northwest and centre west, ice flow speeds increase by nearly a factor 10, with many, smaller glaciers flowing straight down to the coastline at several kilometers per year. This complete description of ice motion was only made possible from the coordinated effort of four space agencies: the Japanese Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, the European Space Agency, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The data will help scientists improve their understanding of the dynamics of ice in Greenland and in projecting how the Greenland Ice Sheet will respond to climate change in the decades and centuries to come.

This animation shows how ice is naturally transported from interior topographic divides to the coast via glaciers. The colors represent the speed of ice flow, with areas in red and purple flowing the fastest at rates of kilometers per year. The vectors indicate the direction of flow.

A new NASA study estimates that the region has lost an average of 15 trillion gallons of water per year from 2012 to 2015. Eastern Brazil as a whole has lost on average 28 trillion gallons of water per year over the same time period.

Augusto Getirana, a hydrologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, analyzed the amount of water stored in aquifers and rivers across Brazil from 2002 to 2015, interested in understanding the depth of the current drought.

A new data visualization of 13 years of GRACE data shows the distribution of water across Brazil. Blues indicate increases in water, mostly occurring in the western regions of Brazil in the rainforest. Meanwhile red and orange shows where water stores have declined, occurring mainly in the north and southeast. At the beginning of the data collection, in 2002, Brazil was just coming out of a drought that began in 2000. A wet period followed until 2012 when dry conditions set in again due to a lack of precipitation and higher than usual temperatures, according to supplemental data.

Southeastern Brazil was hardest hit by drought conditions, said Getirana. To make matters worse, Brazil relies on rivers that feed into reservoirs and dams that generate about 75 percent of the electrical power for the country. By September 2014, for example, the Cantareira reservoir system that provides water for 8.8 million people in S√£o Paulo's metro region reported that it was filled to 10.7 percent of its total capacity, a situation that has led to major water rationing.

At NASA, we explore lots of planets and there‚Äôs a lot to love: the mountains on Mars, the rings of Saturn, the 99.77-degree axial tilt of Uranus. But how about a little something for the home team? It‚Äôs Earth Day. Let‚Äôs explore our home planet, too.

Scientists from NASA and around the world have now discovered more than 1,800 planets beyond our solar system. But so far, we haven't found any that match the complexity of Earth. And it is this complexity that challenges Earth scientists as they seek to figure out how the whole planet works as a system.

Earth has oceans, forests, deserts, ice sheets, rain, snow, an atmosphere. And we have life. These are some of the things that NASA‚Äôs 20 Earth-orbiting missions observe and measure in our quest to build the most complete understanding possible of our dynamic planet.

And while the view from space can be awe-inspiring, our satellites do not see the world the way you do, what makes your corner of Earth special ‚Äì what makes it home.

Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 2 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket is targeted for 6:20:42 a.m. PST (9:20:42 a.m. EST) at the opening of a three-minute launch window. If needed, a backup launch opportunity is available on the Western Range on Jan. 30 with the same launch window.

SMAP is the first U.S. Earth-observing satellite designed to collect global observations of surface soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state. High-resolution space-based measurements of soil moisture and whether the soil is frozen or thawed will give scientists a new capability to better predict natural hazards of extreme weather, climate change, floods and droughts, and will help reduce uncertainties in our understanding of Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles.

The mission will provide the most accurate and highest-resolution maps of soil moisture ever obtained, mapping the globe every two to three days from space for a least three years. The spacecraft's final circular polar orbit will be 426 miles (685 kilometers) at an inclination of 98.1 degrees. The spacecraft will orbit Earth once every 98.5 minutes and will repeat the same ground track every eight days.

Nine of the 10 warmest years since modern records began have now occurred since 2000, according to a global temperature analysis by scientists at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.

2014‚Äôs record-breaking warmth continues a long-term trend of a warming climate. The global average temperature has increased about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since 1880, with most of that warming occurring during the last three to four decades.

The warming trend is largely driven by the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused by human emissions.

Although it is a weak greenhouse gas, carbon monoxide has important indirect effects on global warming. The reaction of CO with other chemical compounds in Earth's atmosphere increases the global warming potential of greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide.

The white arrow points to Sumatra. Carbon monoxide levels shown here are as high as 320 parts per billion (ppb), which is way off the accompanying color scale.

View the data: http://1.usa.gov/1kbVnM9

UPDATE: According to local news reports, some of the more intense fires are burning in the Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve and were deliberately set to clear land for palm oil plantations. The Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve contains just over 700,000 hectares of peat forest that sustains a wide range of plant and animal species including the Sumatra tiger, elephant, tapir, and sun bear.

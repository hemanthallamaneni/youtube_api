This video leaned very heavily on Andreas Malm's book Fossil Capital. Check it out here: https://www.versobooks.com/products/135-fossil-capital 

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the birth of industrial capitalism led to the birth of fossil fuel use at an industrial scale. Specifically, I look at how capitalist forces led factory owners to embrace fossil fuels over water power, despite water being cheaper and more prevalent. Ultimately, capitalism needs power that is both flexible in time and consistent in space and fossil fuels were able to cater to that.

Watch Second Thought's Nebula series on fascism here: https://nebula.tv/thenewfword?ref=occ

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I examine the causes and destruction of our current industrialized food system. Specifically, I dive into the capitalist commodification of food, and how most of the industrialized farming that takes place in the imperial core doesn't produce crops for our consumption. Instead, the majority of the ""food"" we grow goes toward animal feed and biofuels. In addition, the fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides that our current industrialized farming system gobbles up are derived from fossil fuels. Essentially, fossil fuel corporations are laundering their dirty fuels through the very chemicals farmers use to grow their crops. Our food system is broken. We're in desperate need of a new agro-ecological revolution.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I explore how patriarchy destroy the planet and drives climate change. Specifically, I look at how threads of patriarchal masculinities, like petromasculinity and ecomodern masculinity are wielded and pervade responses to the climate crisis. These patriarchal responses to climate change not only obstruct needed action, but they have devasting consequences for gender liberation and environmental health.

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I look at the validity of vegan and plant-based diets as a solution to climate change. I dive into the human and planetary toll of the meat industry, looking at the massive emissions toll of beef production as well as the exploitative conditions in meat processing plants. Ultimately, I consider whether veganism is an effective tool to dismantling the meat industry and mitigating climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I look at the looming threat of species extinction and biodiversity collapse. Specifically, I uncover the extent of the sixth mass extinction. What it is and how bad it's happening. Then, I work through the key drivers of the acceleration of species die-offs across the planet. I look at how climate change and land use change (read: deforestation) have destructive consequences for the biodiversity climate. Finally, the video dives into the capitalist forces driving this mass extinction event.

I leaned heavily on Siddharth Kara's book, Cobalt Red, for this video: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250284303/cobaltred

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I look at the horrors of the cobalt supply chain fueling the electric car and renewable revolution. Specifically, I zero in on cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo in under to uncover what exactly it takes to bring modern batteries to life. The conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo are dismal and are fueled by a long history of colonial plunder and imperialism. To forge an environmentally ethical world that avoids the worst of climate change, we cannot turn a blind eye.

In this Our Changing Climate video essay, I take a brief look at China's climate responsibility. Specifically, I dig into whether or not China is the primary driver of climate change, or whether they are trying to build a zero-carbon future. When it comes to China, a country of more than 1.4 billion people, nothing is simple. Especially when it comes to climate change. China is home to massive coal production, but also massive renewables production. This video tries to figure out exactly what role China is playing on the global climate action stage.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at the importance of speculative climate fiction, sci-fi, and utopias for political movements. Specifically, I look at various short stories, films, and books that introduce us to worlds beyond capitalism, that have, in their own way addressed our ecological and climate crisis.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at what it really takes to save the planet. Specifically, I look at the role of fossil fuel infrastructure sabotage in the climate movement. I weigh whether property destruction and sabotage are useful strategies for the broader climate action movement. The video lends some historical context to a possible climate sabotage wing and examines the radical flank effect.

For this video, I leaned heavily on Andreas Malm's ""How To Blow Up A Pipeline"": https://www.versobooks.com/books/3665-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline

As the world gets warmer and fossil fuels become increasingly untenable there are now glimpses of two trends within the far right that are a reaction to climate change. Ecofascism and fossil fascism.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why the myth of overpopulation is actually a problem. Specifically, I look at how overpopulation is leading to dangerous conclusions both on the right and the left. On the right, it's leading to conclusions of population control, murder, and ethnic cleansing. On the left, it manifests as birth control access, but is still couched in the ideas of population control. Overpopulation is ultimately a myth that at best distracts from the needed work of climate action, and at worst leads to violence.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why we need a war on capitalist Christmas. Specifically, I look at the history of how capitalism stole Christmas, and how we might be able to steal it back. Christmas wasn't always a holiday of private gift-giving, it used to be based in public revelry and the reversal of power. Capitalism has since transformed the holiday into one based on the accumulation of material goods. This needs to change.

Watch next month's video early here: https://nebula.tv/videos/occ-why-we-actually-need-a-war-on-christmas

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at climate hypocrisy and carbon guilt. Specifically, I dig into why I don't care about your flight emissions, and how our attention to individual carbon footprints and worries about being seen as hypocritical distract from the task of dismantling the fossil fuel industry. Indeed, the fossil fuel industry and pundits allied with oil and gas wield the negativity of hypocrisy to stymie climate movements and fracture power. In short climate hypocrisy and carbon guilt individualizes a crisis that can only be tackled collectively.

I highly recommend checking out this article by writer Mary Annaise Heglar  (which definitely influenced this video): https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/28/18629833/climate-change-2019-green-new-deal

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the rich really cause climate change. Specifically, I look at how the focus on the richest people in the world's consumption habits (i.e. our obsession with Taylor Swift's jet emissions) distracts us from how they make their money in the first place. It is through their control and power over production that the rich drive emissions through the roof in pursuit of profits. In order to understand the climate crisis, in order to understand what's driving the climate crisis, we need to look beyond individual footprints and toward the point of production. It is here where the rampant emissions stem from. At the point of production, a handful of individuals make choices that have dire ramifications for billions and dark consequences for the environment.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why fast fashion must end. Specifically, I look at the horrors of both worker and planetary exploitation of the fashion industry. The history of fashion parallels that of industrial capitalism. The pollution and worker exploitation of 18th and 19th-century textile mills and factories have just been upgraded and exported to the 21st century. Today with brands like ASOS, Shein, and H&M fashion has turned fast fashion into ultra-fast fashion with extremely quick turnarounds and daily style releases crushing workers in the imperial periphery and pumping emissions into the atmosphere. The current state of the fashion industry is destroying our planet and our very lives.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why the suburbs are so terrible for people and the planet. Specifically, I look at the racist history of the suburbs in the United States in order to understand how the suburbs came about. The suburbs have a dark history of white supremacy and settler colonialism that suburbanites still wrestle with today. Suburban design, a result of white flight and fear of the perceived ills of the city,  locked in a way of living and a way of moving about the landscape that is incompatible with the environment. The suburban lifestyle is not sustainable, both in terms of our well-being and our planet.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why disaster capitalism exists and how it works. Specifically, I dive into the core principles behind disaster capitalism-- how crises are exploited to pass neoliberal policies, turn a profit, and privatize land and resources previously held in common. But I also dive into how climate change and the climate crisis are a gold mine for disaster capitalism. Not only does capitalism destabilize communities on the frontlines of climate change and climate disasters, but it also capitalizes on the destruction of these natural disasters, further entrenching free-market capitalist ideas and policies. Capitalism is fueling climate change as well as profiting and exploiting the wreckage it leaves in its wake.

Check out the full-length companion video on Capitalism's biggest gamble here: https://nebula.app/videos/occ-capitalisms-biggest-gamble

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why work is killing us and the planet. Specifically, I unpack how wage work under capitalism is inherently a system of exploitation of people and planet. In order to truly forge a zero-carbon world, we must do away with wage work and transform our relationship with work. Culturally, economically, and politically we are forced to work the majority of our lives, often in meaningless positions or doing environmentally destructive tasks. The end of work might start with something like the four-day work week, but it must go farther into establishing a world wherein we don’t have to work to survive but instead work for pleasure.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at whether seaweed and kelp farming can save the planet and curb emissions like its promoters say seaweed does. Seaweed farming has existed for centuries but it only recently has come into the spotlight in the imperial core for its potential to grow food and animal feed as well as suck thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and emissions out of the air. Seaweed farming could be an essential tool in mitigating emissions and drawing down millions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and back into the earth.

Check out Andrewism's video here: https://youtu.be/Rz51PkJy2c0

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at ways in which we can build a Solarpunk future right now. Solarpunk envisions a world in which nature and humanity are seamlessly intertwined, and it does this through a combination of low and high-tech stools as well as political ideologies that center on justice and the environment. Solarpunk solutions might look like Earthships which are already being constructed around the world with hand tools and human ingenuity. Earthships employ many principles of design that lend well to a Solarpunk world. Earthships are generally made from recycled materials and are rammed full of packed dirt local to the area. The Earthship takes advantage of the sun and the wind through passive heating and cooling as well as solar panels, it collects rainwater, and incorporates nature into the house through indoor greenhouses that connect the Earthship dweller with nature as well as provide resilience. There are also Solarpunk solutions readily available right now for transportation. That comes in the form of sailing in the form 21st century. Sailing is a Solarpunk solution because its ties our economy and our materials to the rhythms of the sea and of nature. Ultimately Solarpunk envisions a world that might be slower, but more intentional. One that ties humanity closely to the natural world. Luckily we already have many Solarpunk tools to create that future at our disposal today.

Find the Nebula extended video here: https://nebula.tv/videos/occ-why-electric-cars-wont-save-us

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why electric cars won't save us. Specifically, I unpack why electric cars still have emissions tied to them as well as solidify imperialist extraction in the global south. That being said, electric cars are still much better for the planet and for people than gas-powered, fossil fuel-guzzling cars. My question, however, is whether completely replacing gas cars with electric cars is a justice-oriented answer to the climate crisis. To that, I offer up free and electrified public transportation like trams and buses as an alternative that would expand access to cities, especially for low-income people, and minimize our material footprint. Public transportation is essential to creating an ethical and ecologically focused future.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how climate change will create a massive refugee crisis and how militarized borders are making the climate crisis worse. Specifically, I look at a number of studies that project hundreds of millions of people will be displaced from their homes due to climate change by the end of the century. Unfortunately, imperial core countries like the United States have started building walls to keep people out instead of building bridges to help people escape the storm that the imperial core is largely to blame for. Militarized borders will only make the climate refugee crisis worse, so it's no wonder that the ties between private border security contractors and fossil fuel companies are intimate. In a time when the imperial core needs to be repaying their climate debt and helping countries in the imperial periphery adapt and thrive in a zero-carbon future, they are doing the exact opposite and strengthening their borders and surveillance states.

Check out the extended edition of this video here: https://nebula.tv/videos/occ-how-the-us-stole-land-from-millions-of-black-farmers

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at the history of Black farmers in the United States. Specifically, I look at how systems of oppression, slavery, and the racist machinations of the USDA dispossessed Black farmers of copious amounts of land. Over the course of three centuries, white settlers and white supremacist governmental operations made it extremely hard to be a Black farmer. That being said, Black farmers have a rich history of resistance and collective struggle. From farmer's unions to the Black belt communist and sharecropper uprisings, to the teachings and innovations of Booker T. Whatley and George Washington Carver, Black farmers have pushed back against America's white supremacist industrial agricultural system. In doing so, black farmers have developed agricultural techniques that guide us towards new anti-racist, anti-colonial, and anti-capitalist paths.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why we need radical climate hope and optimism. Specifically, I look at the roots of doomerism and anxiety and offer up radical climate hope as an alternative. To be clear this is not the pie-in-the-sky hope that ignores systems of oppression and waits around for savior tech. ologies to deliver us from climate chaos. No. This is a hope that envisions a liberated world where climate action is taken seriously and intertwines with other movements for justice. Radical revolutionary climate hope requires us to understand the systems of oppression that surround us and then in defiance imagine and create a better world.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how corporations use greenwashing to not only mask their polluting practices but also change what change means. Specifically, I look at how greenwashing is just another example of the resilience of capitalism. Greenwashing allows companies and corporations like Fiji, Coke, and Nestle to continue polluting and emitting. By telling its consumers that they're doing good and then turning around and doing the exact opposite, these big multinationals are able to protect their bottom line. In order to greenwash, companies only have to throw a pittance at sustainability projects and then just market their ""green initiatives"" heavily. Greenwashing is an insidious tool of the capitalist class and is crushing our ability to decipher what is actually making change.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I explain why America will never be a climate leader. Specifically, I look at how the United States has spent over 40 years attempting to pass climate legislation and take climate action but because of partisan gridlock and the firm hold fossil fuel companies and the capitalist class have on the government, nothing substantial has gotten done. As a result, the emissions levels of the United States are much higher than in the 1980s. But the United States not only has failed on climate change and climate leadership domestically but also internationally. The United States continues to block climate agendas that foreground climate reparations, and through its massive military pollutes the air and destabilizes regions especially susceptible to climate change. The United States will never be a climate leader because it is a huge obstacle to effective climate justice and climate action.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why eco-modernism is not not only not a solution to the climate crisis, but also could create a capitalist climate disaster.  Eco-modernism, at its core, is a capitalist philosophy that seeks to escape climate change and environmental destruction through technological innovation, agricultural intensification, and city densification. Elon Musk and Bill Gates are perfect examples of eco-modernist. Both seek to harness current, and more importantly, future technologies like carbon capture and next-generation nuclear reactors to decouple emissions from economic growth. Ultimately eco-modernism seeks to maintain business-as-usual capitalism by relying on untested technologies and unproven theories.

This Our Changing Climate climate change video spotlight's video on climate anxiety. In it, he gives some suggestions on how to transform climate anxiety into effective climate action with this video! With the ongoing climate crisis, it is easy to feel anxious and hopeless but action is our only way out. This is a video to encourage hope and optimism towards climate action.

With ecosystems around the world being destroyed, the sixth mass extinction going on, more intense hurricanes and heatwaves, and the average global temperatures rising- it is natural to feel extremely anxious and even spend sleepless nights worrying about our future.  There is a real term for this suffering and fear for our survival - climate anxiety.

A team from the University of Bath surveyed 10,000 children and young people (aged 16-25 years) in ten countries for climate anxiety.  Nearly 60% of the respondents were extremely worried about climate change and felt sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. 

We can make a difference in climate action via Drawdown and Regenerative solutions. The video also features  @Climate Town  for his eloquent description of organizations to join for climate action. Check out his channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVLG9pThvBABcYCm7pkNkA

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how capitalism and consumerism stole the holidays, specifically Christmas. Specifically, I look at how the holiday season has been bogged down by rampant consumerism. Consumerism born out of the relentless drive for profit and growth of capitalism. As a result of these pursuits, the environmental toll has been catastrophic. Presents and gift-giving continue to increase and much gets exchanged, sent back, or ends up in the landfill. These add to the amount of waste and emissions we already create under capitalism. Ultimately, the only path forward is to work towards the fall of capitalism and imperialism and in its place embrace political tendencies like ecosocialism or ecoanarchism that seek liberation for the masses while nurturing an ethical relationship with the natural world.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video short, I look at why tree planting is not the silver bullet carbon sequestration method so many think it is. While trees have the potential to sequester lots of carbon from the air, the time it takes them to mature, the susceptibility to wildfires, and the fact they are often planted in monocultures mean that they are less effective than we would like to believe.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why net zero emissions targets are a scam. Specifically I look at how the promises of net zero at COP26 will not actually mitigate climate change quickly. Net zero emissions does not mean zero emissions. Countries and companies like BP can use the net zero emissions goals and targets to continue burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide, ultimately fueling the climate crisis, while they rely on the false promise of carbon capture and carbon sequestration techniques like tree planting or technologies that haven't even been invented yet. Essentially, net zero emissions schemes allow for a worsening of the climate crisis because they are a procrastination technique for countries and corporations who do not want to reduce their emissions. Because of the vague definition of net zero, even fossil fuel companies like BP could call themselves net zero yet still continue with business as usual.

Permablitz, a contraction of permaculture and blitz seeks to enact the principles and designs of permaculture onto the local landscape through quick direct and collective action. Permablitzing can mean gathering your friends or community members to build a community garden over the course of the day or moving through the streets and planting edible flowers and plants in vacant lots or sidewalk greenways. Permablitzing has the potential to quickly and easily green your local surroundings while also strengthening the connections between community members

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why plastic isn't the only threat to our seas and oceans. Specifically, I look at how overfishing threatens fisheries fish populations. worldwide. Overfishing has already decimated Atlantic cod and bluefin tuna fisheries and threatens many more. Fishing as a practice has been a staple in many diets for thousands of years but it wasn't until the commodification of fish under capitalism and the heightened industrialization of the fishing trades that global fish population and stocks began to seriously plummet. With inventions like the bottom trawler and big net fishing, fisherfolk are able to catch copious amounts in comparably little time. Overfishing has been devasting to the rich biodiversity of the oceans, rendering some areas devoid of important fish species. So, while ocean plastic and ocean trash clean-up efforts like #teamseas are at least doing something, there is much more threatening our oceans than plastic.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how we end climate imperialism through climate debt. With COP 26 on our doorstep, it's more important than ever to talk about climate debt and climate imperialism. Climate debt is a concept developed to reveal the unequal relationship between Global North (the imperial core) and the Global South (the imperial periphery) caused by centuries of imperialism, colonialism, and climate change. Climate debt demands countries in the imperial core pay reparations for the damage they've done to people, atmosphere and planet. For countless COPs countries in the imperial periphery have pushed for repayment of climate debts, but have been rebuffed over and over. In part, this is why The World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth took place in Cochabamba in 2010. Indeed, the People's Agreement that came out of the Cochabamba People's Conference highlights climate debt as an essential tool in the fight to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I answer the question, can small-scale farming feed the world? Specifically, I look at how industrial farming and the green revolution have led to increased farming emissions and severely depleted soil health. Small-scale farming, which I define as regenerative farms employing traditional knowledge, crop diversity,  and low carbon tools, can not only feed the world but do so in a manner that mitigates and possibly reverses the effects of climate chaos and industrial agriculture. Small-scale farms also offer a place to build movement power. A refuge to build people power and transform our current untenable capitalist system. Small-scale farming can mean big change.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why solarpunk gives me hope for the future in a world ravaged by climate change and climate chaos. Specifically, I answer the question, what is solarpunk? As well as propose tangible solarpunk solutions like solar cookers and solar ovens, makerspaces, and 21st-century zero-carbon airships. Solarpunk presents a vision of the world that is simultaneously hopeful and worth fighting for. Solarpunk envisions a more just future that incorporates leftist liberatory ideologies into a world that has successfully established a world that is both human-centric and nature-centric. As a result, solarpunk stands in stark opposition to the current capitalist profit-centric world we live in. Solarpunk gives us art, dreams, and culture that are worth fighting for, and it grounds that future in the tools and technology already available.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why these tipping points are code red for our planet and how the climate crisis and capitalism are driving us closer to the edge. Specifically, I look at climate tipping points like the Amazon rainforest dieback and the melting of the permafrost in order to grasp what exactly is at stake if we don't act now on climate change and the climate crisis. The Amazon rainforest dieback tipping point is currently being driven by Amazon rainforest deforestation and climate change-driven extreme heat. and wildfires. If left unchecked, climate change and deforestation could mean an irreversible die-off of the Amazon rainforest. Another tipping point of consequence is the melting of the permafrost. Permafrost melt creates a positive feedback look and could potentially release hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 and methane into the air, further warming the climate. Tipping points then show us that action needs to be taken right now or else irreversible consequences will soon arrive.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how United States imperialism is causing climate change and killing the world. Specifically, I look at how the United States is responsible for a large amount of the world's cumulative emissions, the birthplace of the oil industry, and now fosters a growing natural gas industry. While the United States has promised substantial. emissions cuts, they are too slow and too late. The United States' imperialist endeavors abroad have also worked to destabilize regions and prevent resilience in the face of climate change. From protecting oil fields and fossil fuel interests in the Gulf and Iraq Wars to various attempted coups, United States imperialism has made it that much harder to deal with climate change. In addition, United States-backed sanctions have also dealt crushing blows to countries try to build resilience in the face of COVID-19 and the climate crisis. In short, driven by profit and territorial expansion, the United States is not only causing climate change but also making it worse for those on the frontlines.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video, I look at how hemp could save the world from climate change. Obviously, there’s no one solution to climate change, but hemp and hemp cultivation could unlock a lot of alternatives to industries that currently emit tons of CO2 every year. Hemp is not only beneficial for the soil, but it also sequesters a substantial amount of carbon dioxide. Also, hemp is one of the fastest-growing crops. Hemp has over 25,000 uses which means, if grown right, hemp could replace everything from cotton to concrete to plastic and sequester millions of tons of carbon in the process. Hemp is truly a miracle crop and should be seen as a plant that’s sustainable and a viable solution to countless problems we now face in the climate crisis.

In this special Our Changing Climate video, I showcase Aime Maggie's video on sustainable housing. The video dives into why suburbs are terrible for the environment, how highways destroy habitat and ultimately lead to a decrease in biodiversity. Aime also touches on white flight and the connections between city planning and suburbs with racism. Ultimately Aime looks at the reality of urban decay and possible solutions and avenues through which we might be able to create more sustainable housing and ultimately cities.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why Elon Musk won't save us from climate change. Specifically, I look at how Elon Musk's companies like Tesla and SpaceX adhere to a. philosophy of ecomodernism that employs ideologies of techno-optimism and decoupling to tackling the problems of the climate crisis. Elon Musk won't save us because companies like Tesla are exploiting workers in Tesla factories, as well as utilizing capitalist, colonialist methods of extraction that rely on child labor in cobalt and lithium mines. Elon Musk's future is one where the ruling class enjoys the luxuries of his companies like the Tesla Cybertruck or the Las Vegas Loop System, or even a martian space colony, all at the expense of laborers and the working class. Elon Musk shows that ecomodernism is an untenable solution to the climate crisis and climate change. Not only does decoupling not work, but futuristic technologies have very tangible consequences for people and for the planet.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why celebrities won't save us from climate change. Specifically, I look at how celebrities like Leonard DiCaprio and Jane Fonda approach climate action and climate change in order to figure out whether celebrities are actually creating the change we need in order to address climate change and the climate crisis. Leonardo DiCaprio represents a more top-down celebrity approach to climate action. Choosing the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation as one of his main vectors of climate action. Leonardo DiCaprio does wield his wealth for climate action but his approach is very much in line with neoliberal capitalist thinking that exacerbated the climate crisis. Jane Fonda, on the other hand, seems to be taking a movement-based approach to wielding her celebrity.  Jane Fonda uses direct action and getting arrested as a method to shine the spotlight on the work being done on the frontlines as well as work dismantling capitalist extraction industries. Ultimately Jane Fonda and Leonardo DiCaprio represent different approaches to how celebrities use their fame to spur climate action.

Watch the extended version of this video here: https://nebula.tv/videos/our-changing-climate-why-lawns-must-die

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why the American lawn must die. Specifically, I look at the grass lawn's history of class exploitation and settler colonialism and how that ties into the American lawn culture we see today. The lawn began in Europe as an elite status symbol that was tended and mowed by peasants freshly forced into wage labor through the enclosure of the commons. The turfgrass lawn was then exported to colonial America where it was used as a tool to terraform indigenous land. And in the post-WWII suburban boom, the lawn soon became a symbol of white conformity. The turfgrass lawn though has a huge environmental impact. It's the biggest crop in the United States by area and requires a massive amount of fossil fuels, fertilizer, and chemicals to upkeep. Even if you don't want to tend to your lawn, some towns require you, with the threat of jail time to mow the grass. Ultimately, the grass lawn is a tool of capitalist settler colonialism that is exacerbating climate change and the climate crisis.

Help me make more videos like this via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OurChangingClimate

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how we end consumerism. Specifically, I unpack how degrowth and ecosocialism can work in tandem to stop consumerism and overconsumption and reduce emissions in order to transition to a zero-carbon, post-climate change world. Degrowth is a response to the rampant growth/profit capitalist paradigm that fuels consumerism and is causing climate change. Degrowth de-centers capitalism and consumerism and instead argues for a world wherein there's a planned contraction of rich economies to allow for the well-being of everyone in the world. Degrowth, however, can't function well without ecosocialism. Ecosocialism recognizes that the climate crisis is a capitalist crisis and vice versa. In order for degrowth to work it needs to incorporate full democratic control of the means of production and the state in order to avoid draconian measures of austerity. Degrowth and ecosocialism represent an end to consumerism and overconsumption.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why billionaires won't save us from climate change. Specifically, I look at how the elite philanthropy of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk function as more of a billionaire preservation of wealth and self than as an act of altruism. Elite philanthropy from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos in particular seem to solidify their political and social power even more. Bill Gates and his foundation have steered the realm of global health for quite some time (especially during the pandemic) and it seems as if he is using his billionaire wealth to do the same for climate action. Jeff Bezos' $10 billion Earth Fund seems to be functioning in a similar way while also whitewashing the destructive nature of Amazon, aka how Jeff Bezos made his money. Elon Musk is also jumping on the billionaire philanthropy train with a carbon capture prize that is measly compared to his massive wealth. At the end of the day billionaires and billionaire money are not solutions to climate change and the climate crisis, we are.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why capitalism is killing us (and the planet) by causing climate change. Specifically, I look at how capitalism's multinationals like ExxonMobil and BP are responsible for increased emissions and ultimately the climate crisis we are living through today. Capitalism's growth-at-all-costs paradigm runs counter to the material realities of the Earth we live on. In addition to causing climate change, capitalists have found insidious ways to profit off of and engrain free market, neoliberal ideas into the global economy in the wake of climate change-fueled disasters. This is called disaster capitalism and will only get worse as the climate crisis causes more and more chaos. Flying in the face of this capitalist destruction are countless revolutionary movements and ideas that are working to dismantle the profit and growth economy and lift up the people instead. Eco-socialism moving into communism, degrowth, buen vivir, and food sovereignty are just a few philosophical tactics that are being championed by the masses as a means of countering the destructive tendencies of capitalism.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at an aspect of plastic pollution that often is ignored in the face of plastic pollution in the ocean. While ocean plastic pollution is an important issue, plastic is actually a fossil fuel production. This means that the emissions from plastic creation are massive. Unfortunately, the fossil fuel industry sees plastic as a plan B in the face of a renewables transition. This means that plastic pollution in the ocean and the atmosphere will only rise as fossil fuel industries seek to cover their losses. Unfortunately, recycling plastic is not a viable solution. Recycling plastic is actually an industry-backed tool to get people to buy more plastic without actually recycling most of the plastic, leading to lots of plastic pollution. At the end of the day, only bans and a transition away from plastic can halt plastic pollution both in terms of emissions and ocean plastic pollution.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at the true cost of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. Specifically, I look at how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built to fail, not necessarily in the monetary sense, but in terms of the impact Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies have on the environment. Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are not viable solutions to the current financial system because cryptocurrency's blockchain proof-of-work model requires a massive amount of electricity consumption. Essentially Bitcoin miners or other miners of cryptocurrencies use specialized computers to solve math problems and the end result is more Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. This process of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining, however, is environmentally destructive and unsustainable because it demands a huge amount of energy. There are some potential solutions to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency's energy and environmental cost. Switching to a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency model could drastically reduce cryptocurrency's environmental harms. That being said, switching models still doesn't address the rise of crypto-colonialism in places like Puerto Rico.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the Fairphone is one of the most sustainable and ethical smartphones on the market today. From the Fairphone 2 to the Fairphone 3 and now with the newly upgraded Fairphone 3 plus, Fairphone has slowly worked to create the greenest,  most sustainable smartphone that emphasizes modular design alongside an ethical supply chain and conflict-free minerals. The Fairphone 3 plus smartphone's carbon footprint is half the carbon footprint of Apple's iPhone 12 smartphone. One of the biggest sustainable design mechanics of the Fairphone 3 plus is its modular smartphone design. The Fairphone 3 plus' modularity means that the battery can be replaced in seconds, while the Fairphone's screen can be replaced in minutes. In short, the Fairphone 3 plus is one the most sustainable phones in the smartphone space today.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how white supremacy pervades not only the history of environmentalism and environmentalist leaders, but also how white supremacy now threatens the climate change movement and climate action today. The forefathers of environmentalism, conservation, and preservation like Gifford Pinchot, John Muir, and Teddy Roosevelt all espoused white supremacist ideas that were often intermeshed with their views of the natural world and environmentalism. Later as authors like Paul Ehlrich stoked fears of overpopulation, these racist sentiments were blended once again into concerns about overpopulation. In short overpopulation and environmental destruction as a result of overpopulation were wielded as racist and white supremacist tools to oppress people of color, especially in the majority world. Now, mass shooters and eco-fascists are harkening back to the environmentalist, racist, white supremacist views of the past and using climate change as a dangerous weapon and excuse to harm people.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how the electric car was popular in the 1900s and then everything changed. Specifically, I look at how electric cars have been around multiple times and have failed not because of engineering failures but because of cultural and societal issues. Electric cars like Tesla and GM's new electric cars might be the turning point in the road for the electric car, but if we look back at history, the electric car has always faced an uphill battle. Norway's electric car program has been instrumental in showing the world that in order to create an electric car infrastructure, we need to emphasize electric car subsidies, electric car charging stations, and much more. It is possible to transition quickly away from electric cars, we just have to put the effort in to get us there.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how concrete and cement are destroying the planet. Specifically, I unpack why and how concrete and cement work, how concrete and cement create greenhouse gas emissions, how concrete causes climate change, and I also look at the possibility of green cement and concrete. Concrete, through the chemical processes that occur during the production phase, produces a lot of carbon dioxide emissions. For this reason, the concrete industry is one of the largest contributors of greenhouse gases in the world. That also means, however, that concrete could prove a perfect solution to fighting climate change. Green cement and concrete inventions are racking up. Some, like cement and concrete that could sequester and capture carbon leading the way to viable alternatives to conventional cement and concrete.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I answer the question does Evo Morales' eco-socialism work? Specifically, I look at the environmental and socialist actions of Evo Morales when he was president from when he took office in 2006 to the 2019 Bolivian coup that ousted Evo Morales from the presidency. Evo Morales was and still is an environmental champion in some respects, and his socialist agenda and indigenous socialism worked to bring the good life to many Bolivians. Still, Evo Morales participated in an environmentally destructive, capitalist, extractivist global economy. As a result, Bolivia and Evo Morales socialism still caused extraction and environmental harm. At the end of the day though, Evo Morales' eco-socialism and socialist agendas were not the panaceas to climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I answer the question is vertical farming is the future of food? Specifically, the video looks at the problem with vertical farming, the benefits of vertical farming, as well as whether vertical farming is actually a viable solution to solving hunger and combatting climate change. While there are many benefits to vertical farming, like water conservation, location, seasonality, and pest prevention, the current costs and energy requirements of hydroponic and aeroponic vertical farming operations mean they are very costly. Ultimately hydroponic and aeroponic vertical farms have a long way to go before they are an actual solution to sustainable food production, especially when addressing issues like food waste and food infrastructure might be more beneficial.

Help me make more videos like this by supporting me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OurChangingClimate

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why planned obsolescence happens and how planned obsolescence creates waste and emissions. Specifically, I show how planned obsolescence is a symptom of late-stage capitalism and how companies like Apple use perceived and planned obsolescence to make customers buy more of their products. Apple uses planned obsolescence in their batteries and hardware to the extent that once their warranty is up, their devices generally begin to fail. Apple has been sued numerous times for planned obsolescence by Right to Repair campaigns and governments like France claiming that Apple slows down their iPhones, makes it hard to repair iPhones, and generally making iPhones and Mac computers with shorter lifespans. Planned obsolescence is a symptom of late-stage capitalism that pervades a lot of big corporations because it means more consumption ultimately more profit.

In this special Our Changing Climate video, I showcase Rollie at Climate Town's video all about why your carbon footprint is a scam. Through this carbon footprint video, Rollie reveals how and why the BP oil created the idea of the carbon footprint. Over the course of multiple decades, BP used the idea of a carbon footprint to push the responsibility and the burden of carbon emissions onto the individual and away from their own practices. Essentially BP created the carbon footprint as an elaborate victim-blaming scheme. Your carbon footprint matters, but the reason why you have a carbon footprint in the first place is that fossil fuel companies like BP have fought tooth and nail against any kind of transition away from oil and gas.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, we look at how and why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. We look at the last 30 years of television comedies that address climate change from The Simpsons to South Park to The Good Place to Modern Family to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to understand why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. TV comedies use a number of character archetypes that turn environmentalists into obnoxious pariahs, directly deny the existence of climate change in the case of South Park, or build jokes and comedic elements on how hopeless climate action can be. TV comedies ultimately have undermined needed progress on climate change and climate action by approaching the issue of climate change in an unproductive way. To conclude we offer a number of avenues through which TV comedies like The Simpsons, The Politician, and The Good Place might be able to actually spur climate action through jokes and comedy. 

Big thanks to Kate Carter and the NCSE graduate student outreach fellows! They researched and wrote the script for this video.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the problem with grass-fed beef. Grass-fed beef, holistic grazing, and regenerative grazing have recently been championed as solutions to climate change and the climate crisis. The truth about grass-fed beef is that it can't sequester as much carbon as grass-fed, regenerative beef grazing advocates like Allan Savory say it can. Counter to the promises of grass-fed beef and regenerative beef advocates like Allan Savory, most grass-fed beef grazing operations cause more emissions than they capture. Ultimately, grass-fed beef and regenerative beef grazing systems are an unsustainable practice. The real solution is to embrace some form of a plant-based diet. Whether that means going vegan, vegetarian, or forgoing red meat to start, plant-based diets like eating vegan create far fewer emissions than eating grass-fed beef.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the problem with consumerism. Specifically, the video looks at how consumerism and consumption levels negate the environmental benefits of sustainable green growth. As we consume and consume, our consumption levels of materials and energy go up, requiring a larger renewable energy transition to cover. With holidays like Christmas and Black Friday imploring consumers to buy more with deals and advertisements galore. The problem with consumerism, consumption, our materialistic obsessions, and a capitalist growth-centered is that it blocks the amazing progress we've made on the energy efficiency and renewables front. Ultimately, consumerism and consumption must be corrected by a state of deconsumption, degrowth, and minimalism in rich countries. Contracting consumption rates and embracing degrowth, minimalism, and essentialism will make a transition to a 100% renewable world that much better.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at 3 climate change solutions that could actually happen. Climate change solutions and global warming solutions like rooftop solar panels, electric trains, and food waste, the world has so many available ways to drawdown greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. This video dives into just 3 climate change solutions: refrigerant management, onshore wind turbines, and plant-rich or vegan diets. The models from Project Drawdown show that if refrigerant management, onshore wind turbines, and vegan or plant-based diets are scaled up around the globe we could potentially avoid millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions and be well on our way to tackling climate change. These climate change solutions all will require tremendous actions across all levels of society but could provide massive benefits as well.

With the final Donald Trump vs Joe Biden presidential debate wrapped up and the 2020 election drawing near, this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay video looks at what's at stake for climate change when the choice is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden's climate change plan is a surprisingly progressive agenda. Climate justice and climate mitigation are headliners of Joe Biden's climate plan, and the Green New Deal is even mentioned in Biden's climate plan. Compared to Joe Biden, Donald Trump has no climate plan, and a Donald Trump presidency could spell climate change disaster. The Trump White House has spent the last year dismantling countless pieces of environmental and climate change legislation. Unfortunately U.S. election system really only provides two choices: Donald Trump vs Joe Biden. And in this 2020 election, where climate change is a crucial issue, voting for Joe Biden is the better vote for climate action.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the real problem with GMO food, also known as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Specifically, we look at whether GMOs and GMO foods are actually bad both for the environment and for your health. GMOs and genetically modified food like soybeans or corn have long raised the ire of non-GMO food activists because they are supposedly frankenfood that will poison us, as a result, they embrace organic foods. GMO advocates champion genetically modified food as a way to combat climate change, solve environmental issues, and solve world hunger. There are truths and fallacies both of the extremes of the GMO debate, but the reality is, and really the core problem with GMOs is not the technology or the genetically modified food itself, but what GMOs and genetically modified foods are used and controlled. Monsanto's BT and HT crops are a perfect example of how GMO foods are used to create monopolies of environmental destruction.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the industrial agriculture and multinational food and seed corporation Monsanto, which is now owned by the company Bayer. Specifically, this video looks at how Monsanto and now Bayer continue to profit off of and perpetuate a toxic chemical and industrialized farm system through their food empire. I look at how Monsanto continues to sell glyphosate or Roundup despite the overwhelming evidence and lawsuits showing it's harmful effects on humans and animals. Monsanto and Bayer along with three other seed companies now control over 60% of the seed market by patenting GMO seeds. GMO seeds sold by Monsanto have led to increased industrialization and ultimately increased costs in rural areas. Monsanto has essentially created a food empire based on control of GMO seeds, toxic chemicals like neonicotinoids and Roundup glyphosate, and high costs systems that unsustainable for the earth, humans, and the pocketbooks of farmers.

180,G6sLBA-Z-rs,Our Changing Climate,"How This Urban Farm Creates 300,000 lbs of Compost by Hand","In this video brought to you by the Local Motives YouTube channel, we explore how a small community urban farm in Red Hook, Brooklyn produces over 150 tons of compost every year with just hand tools. Through the help of over 2000 volunteers, the Red Hook Community Urban Farm diverts over 300,000 lbs (pounds) of food scraps, food waste, and yard waste from the landfill. This NYC urban farm uses large piles of food waste to create compost. The NYC urban farm not only educates volunteers on how to compost and grow their own food in an urban agriculture environment, but they also put them to work turning compost piles to create the perfect soil for growing organic vegetables and produce. This is an excellent example of how small farms, collective work, and a good idea can make a big impact on climate change.

181,vB68xvRb2T4,Our Changing Climate,"Our Global Water Crisis, Explained.","In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, we look at our global freshwater crisis. Specifically, the video investigates how droughts in California and the Amazon lead to water scarcity for local residents, wildfires, and changing landscapes. These droughts are now exacerbated by climate change and will only make water scarcity and water access worse if drastic action is not taken to curb climate change. In addition, California's Central Valley shows clearly how agriculture can make droughts even worse by drawing unsustainable levels of water out of surrounding aquifers. The water crisis around the globe and in Central Valley has become so bad that many residents are forced to get bottled water because their tap or well water is contaminated or non-existent. In short, we're facing a global water crisis, a shortage of water that, if addressed through water conservation and climate change can be avoided.

The script for this video was written by NCSE Graduate Student Outreach Fellow Annie Stoeth.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at Coca-Cola's plastic pollution and water use and waste. Coca-Cola (Coke) has now become synonymous with plastic pollution and one audit of ocean trash claims Coke is the most polluting brand in terms of ocean plastic. In part, this is due to Coca-Cola's switch to plastic bottles in this U.S. in the middle of the 20th century. Plastic is much cheaper to produce but the costs are offloaded onto the oceans and environment. Coca-Cola (Coke) also heavily drains local watersheds and aquifers and in countless locations has led to crop loss and drought. Essentially, wherever Coke goes there's bound to be plastic pollution and water problems.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the solutions for and whether it's even possible to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050. Specifically, this video looks at the obstacles renewable technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, solar power, and solar energy face in the coming decade by unpacking some of the common arguments fielded against renewables. The documentary, Planet of Humans, was recently published and is a prime example of this kind of renewable bashing. Ultimately though, I show that the problems facing renewables like wind turbine energy and solar panel energy are surmountable through existing technologies like pumped-hydro storage and grid interconnectors. Ultimately, 100% renewable fossil-fuel-free energy is not only possible but necessary to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how The New York Times is in the oil business. Specifically, the video focuses on fossil fuel advertising in The New York Times in order to understand how The New York Times has aided companies like Exxon, Chevron, Mobil, and BP in reaching readers and viewers with their advertisements. The New York Times has allowed the oil and gas company Mobil and then later ExxonMobil to run countless advertorials in their opinion pages that look very similar to opinion pieces. Now, ExxonMobil and Chevron employ the New York Times through the Times' brand studio to create ads and advertising materials. The advertisements themselves are blatant greenwashing. One NY Times creation for ExxonMobil greenwashes them as a clean energy innovator when they so clearly not. This combination of fossil fuel companies and journalism could be a dangerous duo for climate change and climate action.

185,ypV58yWN8xw,Our Changing Climate,Why we need a Green New Deal right now.,"In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why a Green New Deal is so important right now. Championed in the U.S. by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), Ed Markey, and the Sunrise Movement, the Green New Deal offers a solution to global warming and climate change through broad social programs addressing not only fossil fuels but also racism, capitalism, ableism, and imperialism. Unlike other market-based climate legislation in the past, the Green New Deal recognizes the connection between climate change and the host of other struggles the U.S. and the globe faces. The Green New Deal represents a shift in the environmental movement from a scarcity mindset to one of abundance that seeks to supply guaranteed clean jobs for those who want them, sustainable housing, and an electrified transportation system all centered around environmental justice. With the recent Black Lives Matter uprisings fighting for racial justice all over the world, the Green New Deal is an essential idea for the modern environmental movement because it shows that you can not have climate action without a racial justice analysis.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why Walmart is so cheap. Specifically, the video investigates the hidden environmental costs of Walmart and tackles whether or not Walmart is actually as sustainable as they claim. For over a decade and a half, Walmart has asserted itself as an environmental leader by constructing new renewable projects, minimizing their waste, and leaning on their supply chain suppliers to become more sustainable. But Walmart's razor-thin margins, cheap costs, and hypergrowth mindset have made all of these sustainable efforts useless. Walmart is polluting more than ever and as it continues to roll out options like 2-hour shipping, it will move further from a zero-carbon company and towards an environmentally destructive one.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how McDonald's cheap food exists within and has in many ways created a food system that values cheap food that forces environmental damage. Specifically, the video focuses on McDonald's Big Mac to understand the environmental consequences of hamburger beef. The video looks at the high emissions and pollution of unsustainable CAFOs and feedlots that McDonald's meat comes from. The video essay also looks at McDonald's other sustainable initiatives like plant-based meats and biodegradable packaging, but ultimately McDonald's sustainability efforts are always spurred by profit interests and not environmental concerns.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I join forces with @ClimateAdam to look at silver bullet geoengineering solutions to climate change. Specifically, we look at how silver bullet geoengineering ideas can be appealing in theory, but in practice they often have a lot of ethical, economic, and social drawbacks. We dive deep into two geoengineering practices that some are touting as climate saviors: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage and Solar Radiation Management (specifically Stratospheric Aerosol Injection). Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage is a very appealing geoengineering technology but it requires massive amounts of land if it is scaled up. Stratospheric Aerosol Injection essentially dims the sun and there are many climate-related drawbacks as well as political ramifications that could arise if we use aerosol injections as a way to stave off the worst of climate change. Essentially these geoengineering silver bullet propositions are in many ways an excuse for us to continue business as usual instead of digging in and actually reducing emissions.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, we look at how climate change is causing a decrease in biodiversity worldwide. Biodiversity is a measure of the variety and variability of life, and climate change is causing the decline of biodiversity in numerous ecosystems via extreme weather, sea-level rise, and habitat destruction. Biodiversity matters because without such a variety of life and species, ecosystems begin to collapse ultimately affecting the livelihoods of communities reliant on healthy, biodiverse ecosystems. Biodiversity loss caused by climate change ultimately means species extinctions and a disconnect between animals and plants.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how Donald Trump uses the Coronavirus (COVID-19) as an excuse and distraction in order to dismantle essential environmental regulations. With the world focused on the Coronavirus, the Trump administration has halted the EPA's environmental compliance enforcement wing, pushed through an anti-science and anti-environmental agenda, and reversed fuel efficiency standards among other environmental changes. COVID-19 has been an excellent excuse for the Trump administration to deregulate oil and gas industries but as a recent study shows, the air pollution from these industries could be exacerbating the Coronavirus pandemic. So, not only has the Trump administration bungled the response to COVID-19, but they are also actively making the Coronavirus, the environment, and climate change worse.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why Trader Joe's is so popular and whether it is really that sustainable? This video compliments Polymatter's video on Trader Joe's (linked below), with the purpose of looking at the four main ways Trader Joe's addresses its environmental impact. Through food waste, packaging, sourcing, and energy, Trader Joe's creates a mixed bag of environmental actions and impacts. It has thoroughly addressed its food waste problem and is beginning to minimize its packaging impact. But it's hard to tell where its products come from and they don't have any public emissions reduction plans. At the end of the day, Trader Joe's is not the most ethical or sustainable company. It listens to what its costumers want and does it. That's what makes it so popular as well.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the problem of food waste. Specifically, I look at how food waste both in America and across the world is a massive problem for climate change, the environment, and hunger. By addressing food waste in farms, grocery stores, and at home, we could potentially feed billions of people and curb the massive emissions generated to make food and from food waste that ends up in the landfill. There are some pretty simple fixes to food waste like creating a shopping list, using guides to figure out when your food actually spoils, or creating a compost area and then composting food scraps. As a Vox video on the topic puts it, food waste is the world's dumbest problem. But if we address food waste head-on, we will be well on our way to solving climate change and mitigating world hunger.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how we’ve responded globally to the Coronavirus in order to understand how we should and could respond to climate change. Specifically, I look at how countries like China, South Korea, Singapore, Italy, and the United States have quickly mounted large governmental responses to the coronavirus. Covid-19 is a serious global and political crisis, but the coronavirus shows us that rapid behavioral and structural change is possible in the face of a crisis, and climate change is a crisis. The response to Coronavirus (Covid-19) has been quick and broad, the response to climate has been slow and small. If we treated climate change like we have Covid-19, also known as the coronavirus, we would be well on our way to zero-carbon future.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the social and environmental impacts of ExxonMobil's vast fossil fuel empire. From the Exxon Valdez Oil spill to their pipeline projects in Chad and Cameroon, ExxonMobil has carved a sharp path through communities and through the climate. ExxonMobil is so big that it essentially functions as its own country, able to influence and destabilize whole regions as well as pump millions of tons of fossil fuels into the air. ExxonMobil has also fueled an extensive campaign fighting climate science and climate action. By sponsoring think tanks and climate deniers, ExxonMobil has delayed necessary climate action for decades. Essentially, ExxonMobil is a private sector behemoth capable of destroying the environment and whole countries for decades to come.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I take on Amazon. Specifically, I look at how Amazon prime shipping and delivery services impact the environment and the workers who rush to fulfill such tight deadlines. Looking at shipping services like Amazon Flex and investigating the conditions in Amazon warehouses I try to answer the questions of why is Amazon so cheap? What does Amazon really cost In short, Amazon's grand theory of consistent need for speed to fulfill prime one-day and two-day ship orders means high environmental impacts and crushing loads on workers both in the warehouse and out for delivery. So, when you purchase an Amazon product the burden of that cheap price tag lands on workers and the environment.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what you can do about climate change using individual, personal, and collective actions. This video, however, is not a simple list of the best things a person can do to change their lifestyle and shrink their carbon footprint, instead I start by looking at the way in which we’ve globally become fixated on individual solutions to climate change. We envision ourselves more as consumers than as citizens. As a result carbon footprint related actions like flying less and recycling are prioritized over voting, protesting, and system change. This video is all about doing both personal things to lower your carbon footprint like driving less, but simultaneously acting collectively to create a system in which having a small carbon footprint is feasible for everyone.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why Australia, the Amazon, and the Central African Congo Basin is on fire. Specifically, I look at the scope and damages of the Australian fires for the 2019-2020 fire season and compare them to those of the Amazon and Congo fires. The video also delves into how climate changes influences and enhances the damage of wildfires and has lead to more intense fires across Australia and the Amazon. But this video essay also shows that the deregulation stances of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are partly to blame for the increase of fires in their respective countries.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the corporate environmental and ethical actions of Recreation Equipment, Inc. (REI co-op) as well as their corporate responsibility structure in order to decide whether they are a co-op. REI co-op claims they are a member-based co-op, yet members have very little say in how the company is run. As such, the co-op name that REI co-op uses seems more like a marketing ploy than an actual business structure. In addition, this video looks at the environmental causes and plans put in place by REI co-op. While they are ambitious in their drive for ""Corporate Responsibility"", these methods seem to be in line with what their customers want to see, which ultimately means more sales and growth.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the true cost of coffee. Specifically, I look at how shade-grown coffee and sun-grown coffee are cultivated in order to understand the environmental and social consequences of consuming coffee. Worldwide, coffee is the second most popular beverage next to the water, and the large majority of it is produced in the Global South and imported into the Global North. As a result, the environmental destruction caused by sun-grown coffees pollutes and deforests producing countries in order to satiate the thirst for caffeine in Europe and North America.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the environmental and social cost of the military and militarism. I narrow in on the United States military-industrial complex because it is by far the biggest military machine in the world. I look at how the military and the military-industrial complex is a massive polluter in terms of both emissions and chemical waste. In addition, the video looks at whether or not these environmental and monetary burdens caused by the military-industrial complex are justified. Have the multitude of wars the United States has wage been just, or are they manifestations of imperialism. Ultimately, the video connects environmental destruction with military imperialism and concludes that demilitarization is the only truly effective answer to the carbon footprint of the military.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I investigate the various problems with Black Friday this 2019 season. Using Black Friday as a microcosm for the United States' desire for overconsumption, I look at the environmental impacts of Black Friday and Cyber Monday as well as the social problems of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Specifically, the video dives into the treatment of workers in large companies like Amazon and Walmart and then understands the environmental consequence of the massive consumption spree that is Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In short, the overconsumption of Black Friday is steeped in a profit-over-all model that we must escape if we are to change Black Friday.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at plant-based meats like Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger in order to understand how and why they are replacing conventional beef. Plant-based meats like the Impossible Burger seem to be trying to replacing the environmentally destructive practices of cattle factory farms which is definitely a positive. CAFOs or beef factory farms produce a lot of pollution, emissions, and are a leading cause of deforestation across the globe. Plant-based burger and meat companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods seek to replace these unsustainable practices with what they claim are much more environmentally friendly meats and burgers. But Impossible Burgers and Beyond Burgers are definitely a product of food-tech optimism and are only one solution to a much larger food system problem. While Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are doing a good job at offering viable alternatives they have a lot to work on.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why climate protests matters. Specifically, I look at environmental protests like the recent September climate strikes in order to understand protest's place in creating much-needed climate action. Via various organizations like the Sunrise Movement, Zero Hour, Fridays for Future, and One Million of Us, youth protests across the world are crying out to world leaders to act strongly on climate change. Greta Thunberg certainly has added fuel to this growing fire, but she's not the only climate protest leader. These movements show not only the strength and solidarity of a new wave of climate activists but the mounting pressure on politicians to create broad-based, inclusive, and transformative policies that combat climate change.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why IKEA is so cheap as well as try to understand the environmental consequences of IKEA furniture's cheap cost. Specifically, I look at how IKEA's supply chain management, assemble-it-yourself, and questionable tax avoidance give rise to IKEA's cheap cost. In addition, I also evaluate IKEA as a sustainable company. I try to understand whether IKEA's sustainability goals are all talk or whether they are actually interested in creating an environmentally conscious furniture company.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the difficulties surrounding the Zero Waste lifestyle, especially for beginners. Specifically, I look at how the Zero Waste lifestyle is a good solution to individual waste and single-use items for those that are able, but for beginners, the extremes of Zero Waste can be daunting. So, Zero Waste alternatives are essential for those (or beginners) interested in creating meaningful and lasting change within their system. At the end of the day, Zero Waste can be effective but it can also be daunting and turn many people off exploring their relationship with waste.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the controversy and debate behind plastic straw bans. Specifically, I look at the minimal impact of plastic straws on ocean trash compared to other forms of garbage. The video also discusses how plastic straw bans are a form of eco-ableism in that eliminating plastic straws make the lives of people with disabilities much more complicated. As a result of the eco-ableism inherent in plastic straw bans, ridding whole cities of plastic straws could prove problematic.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the hidden costs and sustainable claims of Apple. Specifically, I look at Apple's efforts to reduce its environmental footprint through solar and wind projects. I also look at the repairability of Macs, iPhones, and iPads in order to figure out whether Apple's sustainability claims are marketing ploys or actual commitments. At the end of the day, Apple's products seem to fuel an increased desire for new and shiny tech, which ultimately leads to more e-waste.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the environmental impact of the internet. Specifically, I dig into how the internet works through data centers and networks, both of which contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions through massive energy demand. In all, the internet does have a huge energy demand, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it has to create a lot of emissions. If the data centers and networks behind the internet instead rely on renewable energies then the internet can possibly be a positive environmental force.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the effects of palm oil on the environment and deforestation. Specifically, I look at how palm oil demand has caused a huge increase in oil palm plantations. As a result, producers clear-cut, log and burn peatlands and primary rainforests in order to make way for palm oil fields. By itself, palm oil is not necessarily a harmful product, but because palm oil is now in thousands of products, the rate at which it's being consumed has caused deforestation and environmental destruction on a large scale.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the greenest form of travel. Specifically, I look at the carbon footprints and emissions of trains, cars, planes, and buses when traveling on vacation or for business. Ultimately, the greenest way to travel greatly depends on the context of the trip. For example, the number of passengers or distance travel greatly affects the efficiency and the ""greenness"" of the trip.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at why Allbirds has become so popular. Specifically, I look at how Allbirds have used sustainably sourced materials like wool and eucalyptus tree fiber to create their wool runner shoes that are both environmentally conscious and comfortable. Allbirds’s wool runners and tree toppers show that innovation and creativity in a stagnant market can lead to highly popular and sustainable solutions. Ultimately, Allbirds shows that in order to create popular products that are sustainable and innovative, you need to be creative and work against the status quo.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the true cost of Samsung smartphones like the Galaxy S10 and the Galaxy Fold. Specifically, I look at the environmental impact of Samsung's phone from manufacturing to waste and see whether they are an eco-friendly smartphone maker. Samsung has had problems with phones breaking in the past like the Galaxy Note 7, which has led to some environmentally disastrous recalls. Considering Samsung owns a large portion of the smartphone market, it's important to consider the environmental consequences of phones that are rushed to the market like the Galaxy Fold.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what role nuclear energy has to play in a renewable energy transition to combat climate change. Specifically, I figure out whether nuclear energy is emissions free or low carbon. I look at the problem of nuclear waste by weighing the differences between long term storage, on-site storage, and reprocessing of nuclear waste. I also look at the prohibitive cost and construction barriers to nuclear energy in order to understand whether it's actually a feasible solution to climate change. Finally, I look at the issue of safety in relation to nuclear energy by comparing the death tolls of other energy outputs to that of nuclear energy.

I dissect the thought of ecofeminist scholars and activists in order to understand how gender and the environment are intertwined. I make comparisons to the environmental justice movements and ultimately ask the questions, what is ecofeminism and is it a useful lens to understand feminism and environmentalism.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at the environmental actions of The North Face clothing. Specifically, I look at how The North Face seems to be torn between environmental actions and sustainability on the one hand and appeasing shareholders on the other. Ultimately, The North Face seems to follow the example of Patagonia and  Fjällräven rather than challenging the outdoor industry to be environmentally ethical and sustainable leaders in their field.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I investigate the environmental impact of dockless scooters like Bird and Lime. I ask a simple question: are dockless scooters environmentally friendly? Unfortunately, the answer is not as simple, and the dockless scooter companies like Bird's sustainability depend on their context. They could have a low carbon footprint if they are replacing a car ride, but if not the scooters' environmental impact could be large. Basically, the environmental impact depends on the way we use a dockless scooter like Lime's.

In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I take a look at the concept of cultural landscapes. I specifically look at how the integration of natural landscapes and human landscapes can create a deep tradition of reverence for the local environment. Cultural landscapes might just offer viable alternatives to industrial agricultural and cultural systems that often overlook the health of the land.

I look at how the third episode of the third season of Avatar: The Last Airbender paints a picture of a small town with little political power polluted by a large Fire Nation factory. This story from Avatar: The Last Airbender mirrors many real-world environmental problems where environmental racism runs rampant and the environmental justice movement seeks to combat.

While eating a plant-based diet does greatly reduce your carbon footprint due to the meat industry's rampant fossil fuels use, going vegan is sometimes not accessible to all.

Neoliberalism sprouted up in the 1970s and with the rise of free-market neoliberal champions like Ronald Reagan and Margret Thatcher, environmental issues began to transform into issues about regulation.

Specifically, I look at how and why the first Earth Day didn't seem to created a progressive left vision that included and joined with the anti-war, civil rights, and women's liberation movements at the time. Instead, the first Earth Day was built upon a coalition of primarily white, middle-class folks interested in environmentalism. This has continued up to today but seems to be changing with the rise of environmental justice movements and the understanding that frontline communities should be those that lead and guide an environmental revolution.

Corrections:

1. Cook et al 2013 has come under increased scrutiny over the last couple years, and has some critical flaws. That being said, the results of multiple surveys of different size and method point to a growing consensus that climate change is real and very likely human caused. 
You can read more on Cook et al and scientific consensus on climate change here: https://hiizuru.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/campaign-of-deception/
As well as here: http://www.factcheck.org/2015/09/santorums-climate-consensus-claims/

2. There is still debate on what exactly caused the mass extinction at the end of the Permian period. Theories point to a large meteor strike, volcanic eruption, or runaway greenhouse emissions as the leading cause of death. (Also, I mistakenly implied that ice core records go back 250 million years. They don't. Ice records really only go back 800,000 years.)

June, July, and August combined were 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (0.23 degrees Celsius) warmer than any other summer in NASA’s record, and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. August alone was 2.2 F (1.2 C) warmer than the average. June through August is considered meteorological summer in the Northern Hemisphere.

This animated map shows monthly temperature anomalies (changes from an average) from summer 1880 to summer 2023 measured with respect to NASA's 1951-1980 baseline period.

285,6PLBEz7o6wc,NASA Climate Change,Antarctic Ice Mass Loss 2002-2023,"The Antarctic ice sheet's mass has changed over the last decades. Research based on satellite data indicates that between 2002 and 2023, Antarctica shed an average of 150 billion metric tons of ice per year, adding to global sea level rise.

These images, created from GRACE and GRACE-FO data, show changes in Antarctic ice mass since 2002. Orange and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002.

Areas in East Antarctica experienced modest amounts of mass gain due to increased snow accumulation. However, this gain is more than offset by significant ice mass loss on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (dark red) over the 21-year period. Floating ice shelves whose mass change GRACE & GRACE-FO do not measure are colored gray.

The average flow lines (gray; created from satellite radar interferometry) of Antarctica’s ice converge into the locations of prominent outlet glaciers, and coincide with areas of highest mass loss (i.e., Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West-Antarctica). This supports other observations that warming ocean waters around Antarctica play a key role in contemporary ice mass loss.

These images, created from GRACE and GRACE-FO data, show changes in Greenland ice mass since 2002. Orange and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002.

In general, higher-elevation areas near the center of Greenland experienced little to no change, while lower-elevation and coastal areas experienced over over 20 feet (6 meters) of ice mass loss (expressed in equivalent-water-height; dark red) over this 21-year period. The largest mass decreases occurred along the West Greenland coast.

Overall, July 2023 was 0.43 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.24 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other July in NASA’s record, and it was 2.1 F (1.18 C) warmer than the average July between 1951 and 1980.

“NASA data confirms what billions around the world literally felt: temperatures in July 2023 made it the hottest month on record. In every corner of the country, Americans are right now experiencing firsthand the effects of the climate crisis, underscoring the urgency of President Biden’s historic climate agenda,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “The science is clear. We must act now to protect our communities and planet; it’s the only one we have.”

289,4-NbXFDj24s,NASA Climate Change,Implications of GRACE data for Water Resources Management,"Two decades of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data have significantly advanced our understanding of global hydrology. Variations in Earth’s gravity monitored by GRACE are controlled mostly by water storage changes, such as those related to droughts, floods, ice melting, and human water use.

The vertically integrated GRACE land total water storage (TWS) variations include surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater. The value of the GRACE TWS parameter is evident in its recent adoption in the IPCC reports as an essential climate variable in assessing climate impacts in hydrology and increasing use of TWS in global models.

Attribution analysis of GRACE water storage variability to human and climate drivers has greatly advanced over time. GRACE satellites were the first to show large scale groundwater depletion in the IndoGangetic Basin. Interpretation of GRACE water storage has improved by integrating additional data on human intervention (e.g., groundwater pumping, water use, land use change) and climate drivers (e.g., precipitation, drought indices).

Some basins show combined effects of human intervention amplifying or dampening climate effects. Recent studies show the value of ground-based monitoring and regional modeling to provide long-term context for GRACE data with large scale net increases in water storage in the IndoGangetic Basin and Northwest US over the past century.

Advances in GRACE processing shows potential value in operational mode for drought and flood warning. Continued advances in applications of GRACE data are expected by combining these data with other satellite data (e.g., SWOT, SMAP) and by using GRACE data to constrain models through data assimilation. The visual power of GRACE data helped communicate water storage variability to the public and influence water policy in many regions, including India and the US.

290,VtT8vZR6tiM,NASA Climate Change,Joanne Simpson and the Tropical Atmosphere,"The life and work of Joanne Simpson (1923-2010) provides an opportunity to say something new about women’s history and the history of science. She was the first American woman to earn a Ph.D. in meteorology. Her path to the top was tortuous, multifaceted, and surprisingly complex – an 86-year rollercoaster ride of passion, soaring intellect, and gritty determination to succeed in a man’s world at all cost and to blaze a trail for other women to follow.

Joanne managed to soar -- like a hot tower Cb -- above all adversity and established the fundamental importance of tropical clouds as the drivers of the global circulation. She led large airborne observing projects, built computerized cloud models, and participated in experimental seeding of hurricanes and clouds.

Her career culminated at NASA, where her most significant work, she said, was as project scientist for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, a satellite-based program launched in 1997 that employed radar and microwave imaging to unravel the dynamics of the tropics, which is home to up to half of the world’s people.

Given her many accomplishments, what is currently known about Joanne is not close to what should be known about her. I was told by her closest associates that this book gave them the opportunity to assemble all the pieces of her life they had come to know (and some they never knew) into a coherent and compelling story of the mentor they loved and respected. This talk provides a deep dive into Joanne’s life to situate her story.

291,XP5r-kZg13k,NASA Climate Change,Harnessing the Power of Geophysical Imaging to Recharge California’s Groundwater,"California’s past has involved cycles of floods and droughts, and this is predicted to continue, with more extreme floods and more extreme droughts due to climate change. There is now great interest in flood-MAR – managed aquifer recharge – where flood water is captured and used for recharge to recover from the last drought and prepare for the next.

Identifying an optimal site for groundwater recharge requires considering many factors, one of which is the subsurface geology. In the Central Valley of California, we are using InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) deformation images, derived from data acquired with the Sentinel-1 satellites, to identify locations where natural recharge is likely occurring.

We obtain information about subsurface materials, required to understand natural recharge and to support managed recharge, using data recently acquired with the airborne electromagnetic (EM) method and with a ground-based EM method. This integration of various forms of geophysical imaging is allowing us to map fast paths for recharge in California’s Central Valley.

292,aWeiV0PHrsI,NASA Climate Change,Cloud Physics from Space,"This talk describes a journey in the progression of cloud physics from a subdiscipline of meteorology into the global science it is today. The journey begins with important post-war contributions of four key individuals who were instrumental in developing cloud physics into a global science. These contributions came on the heels of the post-war weather modification efforts that influenced much of the early development of the science. Progress in the discipline of cloud physics offered by space-based measurements is also outlined.

How this progress is now shedding light on a number of challenges associated with projecting future climate change is described including the connection between the early contributions to cloud physics and the current vexing problem of aerosol effects on cloud albedo. The journey ends by looking to the future noting areas where progress might be expected in the coming decade.

294,AID17XeMiAY,NASA Climate Change,NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) Earth Venture Mission,"Several recent technological revolutions have converged to make possible a new paradigm in spaceborne Earth observations. One is the miniaturization of low power, high performance digital electronic systems, largely driven by commercial products like smart phones and laptops. Another is the rise of cubesats and their transition from educational student projects to highly capable, high reliability small satellites. The third revolution is one of perception. Until recently, major space organizations such as NASA, NOAA, DoD, ESA, and the private sector tended not to view smallsats as a serious part of the toolkit of technologies available to meet their core objectives. But that perception has changed. Not only are smallsats becoming a mainstream element of spaceborne technology, they are enabling new types of measurements and new science and applications that would not otherwise be possible. One example of this is the ability to resolve short time scale geophysical processes such as extreme weather events, made possible by placing large constellations of smallsats in low Earth orbit.

The CYGNSS constellation of eight microsatellites was successfully launched in December 2016 into a low inclination Earth orbit. Each satellite carries a bistatic radar receiver that measures signals transmitted by Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and scattered back into space from the surface. Over ocean, wind speed and air-sea heat flux are measured. Over land, measurements of soil moisture, flood inundation, wetland extent, and river width and slope are made. An overview and current status of the mission will be presented, together with highlights of recent science and applications results.

311,8CgG6C-yTBQ,NASA Climate Change,A Framework for Evaluating Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Information for Decision Making,"Climate change, driven by increases in human-produced greenhouse gases and particles (collectively referred to as GHGs), is the most serious environmental issue facing society. The need to reduce GHGs has become urgent as heat waves, heavy rain events, and other impacts of climate change have become more frequent and severe. Since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, more than 136 countries, accounting for about 80% of total global GHG emissions, have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. A growing number of cities, regional governments, and industries have also made pledges to reduce emissions. Providing decision makers with useful, accurate, and trusted GHG emissions information is a crucial part of this effort.

A National Academies fast-track consensus study was completed to develop a framework for evaluating global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) information to support decision making. The committee, which included Dr. Eldering, examined emerging approaches that supplement self-reported data with other independent data sources in the development and evaluation of global anthropogenic GHG emissions inventories. This study was conducted on an accelerated timeline in order to inform COP27 discussions in November 2022, and created in a framework for evaluating emissions inventories and information, and include several case studies for how such a framework could be applied in practice to specific sector- or country-based emission inventories.

This Distinguished Climate Lecture from the JPL Center for Climate Sciences will focus on the report recommendations and key insights.

About the Speaker:
Annmarie Eldering has over 30 years of experience in the fields of air pollution, greenhouse gases, and remote sensing. She retired from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2022. Her early work at Caltech focused on measuring and modeling the aerosols that form in the Los Angeles Basin and drastically reduce visibility. Dr. Eldering developed advanced computer models to simulate these processes and evaluate possible strategies for emissions reductions and improvement in air quality. At the JPL, she was the Project Scientist on satellite projects to measure tropospheric air pollution (TES) and later carbon dioxide (the Orbiting Carbon Observatories (-2 and -3)). Through these satellite projects, she has worked closely with the modeling community that is combining ground-based measurements, emissions inventories, and satellite measurements in atmospheric models to create the most complete understanding of the carbon cycle and the state of Earth’s atmospheric composition including greenhouse gases. She was also a deputy section manager and section manager in Earth Atmospheric Science at JPL for 5 years, guiding and organizing a cohort of near 100 scientists, technical staff, and postdocs. Dr. Eldering received her B.E. in chemical engineering from Cooper Union and her Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering Science from Caltech.

313,5FU2DAREWbw,NASA Climate Change,Tracking 30 Years of Sea Level Rise,"Thirty years ago, scientists and engineers launched a new satellite to study the rising and falling of seas over time, a task that once could only be done from the coast. TOPEX/Poseidon rocketed into space on August 10, 1992, and started a 30-year record of ocean surface height around the world. The observations have confirmed on a global scale what scientists previously saw from the shoreline: the seas are rising, and the pace is quickening.

Scientists have found that global mean sea level—shown in the line plot above and below—has risen 10.1 centimeters (3.98 inches) since 1993. Over the past 140 years, satellites and tide gauges together show that global sea level has risen 21 to 24 centimeters (8 to 9 inches). That's like covering the contiguous U.S. in about 16 feet (about 5 meters) of water. Recent rates have been unprecedented over the past 2,500-plus years.

314,KU2xslwLIKo,NASA Climate Change,"Towards a Worldwide Observing, Forecasting and Attribution System for Air Quality","Each year, 4 million people die prematurely in the world from outdoor air pollution, to a large extent in low- and middle-income countries. Actions must therefore be taken to improve air quality. Specifically, a major effort is required to implement the latest standards adopted by the World Health Organization.

In support of air quality mitigation, the scientific community has developed observational and modeling tools to measure chemical species using monitoring stations, aircraft-borne instrumentation and satellites, to provide air quality forecasts at the global, regional and local scales, and to project future trends in the chemical composition of the atmosphere. The ultimate goal is to develop attribution approaches that are required to identify the major sources of pollutants and to take appropriate actions that will improve public health.

The seminar will review progress in the development of these tools and will discuss strategic options needed to improve air quality on each continent. Changes in the world economy tend to generate new hot spots and areas of concern about poor air quality. The development of a global network of public and private institutions to address the air pollution question with similarities with the global weather monitoring system is therefore required. It must be complemented by an active dissemination program. Examples of efforts in this direction will be presented.

322,Q-Zsu1__tPU,NASA Climate Change,What NASA Knows from Decades of Earth System Observations,"NASA has the world’s largest Earth-observing fleet, with an uninterrupted record of observed evidence of climate change. Increased greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere.

Trapped atmospheric greenhouse gases warm the planet – our land, ocean, and atmosphere. Most of the global warming goes into the ocean, delaying the full impact of global warming. Ocean currents move the heat around the globe, impacting your local weather and climate. The warmer ocean accelerates melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.

Rising seas are a major consequence of climate change, impacting coastal communities, infrastructure, and the economy. A warmer climate amplifies Earth’s water cycle. Dry areas are getting drier, and wet areas are getting wetter. Wet areas are experiencing more flooding and extreme storms, such as typhoons and hurricanes. Drought-prone areas will see less rainfall, affecting agriculture.

NASA data are used for projections that can help inform actions for the future. More extreme conditions are occurring due to climate change, such as wildfires. NASA data and knowledge are open and free, enabling informed decision-making. The agency's information aids preparation and recovery from natural hazards around the world.

NASA uses the period from 1951-1980 as a baseline to see how global temperature changes over time.

Collectively, the past eight years are the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880. This annual temperature data makes up the global temperature record – which tells scientists the planet is warming.

Aurica — all continents combine into a single landmass near the equator 250 million years into the future.
Amasia — Antarctica stays put, but the other continents combine well north of the equator 200 million years into the future.

326,VbOF--Xgs8s,NASA Climate Change,Global Carbon Dioxide: 2020-2021,"This video shows the accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during a single calendar year. Every year, the world’s vegetation and ocean absorb about half of human-caused CO2 emissions, slowing the rate of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.

However, around 2.5 parts per million (ppm) remain in the atmosphere every year, causing a steady rise in concentrations that scientists have been tracking since the 1950s, at surface stations. (The term ""parts per million"" refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air.)

The visualization starts in June 2020, showing all of the model’s values of global CO2. (All 3D cells of the model are opaque, revealing a solid brick of data.) During this month, the higher values of CO2 coalesce around the ""equatorial belt.""

By mid-July 2020, CO2 values between 385 ppm and 405 ppm in the atmosphere become transparent. These lower values tend to be higher in the atmosphere. By visualizing the data like this, the higher CO2 concentrations, which are closer to the ground, are highlighted, revealing the seasonal movement of high CO2 at a global scale.

During the months of June to September (summer months in the Northern Hemisphere), global CO2 concentrations tend to be the lowest, because Northern Hemisphere plants actively absorb CO2 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis, which is the process of turning sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into food (sugars) and oxygen. During Northern Hemisphere fall and winter months, much of the CO2 is re-released into the atmosphere, due to respiration, and can be seen building up.

By June and July 2021, plants again draw CO2 out of the atmosphere, but notably higher amounts remain there in contrast with the previous year. The daily rhythm of CO2 is apparent over our planet's largest forests, such as the Amazon rainforest in South America and the Congo rainforest in Central Africa.

The fast-paced pulse in those rainforests is due to the day-night CO2 cycle: Plants absorb the greenhouse gas during the day via photosynthesis (when the sun is out), and then stop absorbing it at night.

In addition to highlighting the buildup of atmospheric CO2, the video shows how interconnected the world’s greenhouse gas problem is. NASA’s unique combination of observations and models plays a critical role in helping scientists track CO2 increases to better understand their climate impact.

327,BxrkI9Gamwk,NASA Climate Change,"So What if Warm, Moist Air Rises - Why Should We Care?","Convective storms form through the rising of warm, moist air deep within the atmosphere. These cloud systems significantly impact all life on Earth through the fresh water they provide and the severe weather they produce. They also play a fundamental role in the vertical transport and redistribution of atmospheric properties; assist in driving large-scale atmospheric circulation systems with implications for regional and global climates; and produce upper-level cirrus clouds which influence the magnitude and sign of cloud-radiative forcing. Despite the importance of convective storms, accurately representing these cloud systems in regional weather forecast models through global climate models remains extremely challenging, leaving us poorly prepared to predict and manage the impacts of convection in current and future climates. In this talk I will first describe the critical role played by convective storms in Earth’s weather and climate system. This will be followed by a discussion of some of the fundamental questions still facing the convection community and the challenges in addressing them. I will conclude with several suggestions as to what observations might enhance our theoretical understanding of convective processes and their representation within our regional and climate models.

334,9e9_EtYc9Zw,NASA Climate Change,Mass Change as a Designated Observable: Study Overview and Results,"Abstract:
The value of mass change observations for understanding the Earth system has been highlighted in multiple community reports. Including the 2007 Earth Science and Applications from Space (ESAS) Decadal Survey (DS) with the recommendation of a higher capability GRACE-II Tier-3 mission, 2010 NASA Climate-Centric Architecture report with the recommendation of GRACE Follow-On (2018-present) as a gap-filler mission to continue critical observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE; 2002-2017), and most recently in the 2017 ESAS DS in which Mass Change is listed as a Designated Observable. The Mass Change Designated Observable will “ensure continuity of measurements of groundwater and water storage mass change, land ice contributions to sea-level rise, ocean mass change, ocean heat content, glacial isostatic adjustment, and earthquake mass movement,” as summarized in the 2017 DS. In response to this designation, NASA initiated a multi-center study team led by JPL to study and recommend high-value observing systems for mass change that can be implemented within the next decade and are responsive to the DS science and applications objectives. This talk provides an overview of the study process and key findings. These include the creation of a community-vetted Science and Applications Traceability Matrix, the assessment via numerical simulations of the science value of over 50+ observing system variants, and the utilization of a value framework process that takes into account science value, cost, risk, technology readiness level, schedule, and international partnerships to discriminate between architectures. The study process has led to the identification of a small subset of high-value observing systems to move forward for more in-depth study in Pre-Phase A. Expected science outcomes from this small subset of architectures will be discussed in detail.

335,39WmpLEubnc,NASA Climate Change,"Atmosphere Observing System (AtmOS): Aerosol, Cloud Convection & Precipitation Designated Observable","Abstract:
In late 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine finalized the report of the 2017-2027 decadal survey of Earth Science and Applications from Space. This was the second such Earth science survey and it converged to a final, small set of Science and Applications Priorities and Observing System Priorities starting from a large number of community-provided inputs. Emerging from these were a set of eight designated observables (DO’s) declared to be of highest priority for the decade. Observations of aerosol (A) and separately clouds, convection and precipitation (CCP) were recommended as two of these designated observables. Since the science of each significantly overlap the other, NASA proposed these be combined into a single (ACCP) DO study, now renamed AtmOS. This talk reviews the principal outcomes of the DO study that has now defined AtmOS, its architecture and the main elements of the AtmOS program.

336,CSQ65E9kOKY,NASA Climate Change,Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change (1850-2018),"This animation shows how mid-stratospheric temperature, lower stratospheric temperature, surface temperature, ocean heat content (heat added to the ocean over time from global warming), and Arctic sea ice have changed between 1850 and 2018 from human and natural drivers of climate change. (More information on the layers of Earth's atmosphere can be found here: https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/.)


Each world map and plot comes from a different data source, with white lines representing modern observations. The green lines represent natural drivers, red lines show human drivers, and blue lines illustrate both natural and human drivers — all coming from climate model (simulation) outputs. As expected, the blue lines and white lines match because reliable modern observations (measurements of what actually happened) align with the total simulated data.


Clearly, human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels) dominate temperature increases at the surface (where humans live) and in the ocean.

337,madDm2XWiwo,NASA Climate Change,Why is it so hard to stop global warming? A political and technical analysis.,"For more than three decades the world’s diplomats have been hammering out agreements on global climate change. So far, there is little evidence that all this diplomacy has had much impact. This talk will look at the fundamental technological and economic factors that explain why political and diplomatic progress has been slow. It will also show how new ideas that will allow for more rapid progress are taking hold. European countries have been the leaders on climate action for decades, but parts of the US, China and other places are now joining that leadership. ABOUT THE LECTURER: Dr. David Victor i is a professor of industrial organization and innovation at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at UC San Diego. He co-directs the campus-wide Deep Decarbonization Initiative, an effort to understand how quickly the world can eliminate emissions of warming gases. He is adjunct professor in Climate, Atmospheric Science & Physical Oceanography at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and a professor (by courtesy) in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Prior to joining the faculty at UC San Diego, Victor was a professor at Stanford Law School where he taught energy and environmental law. He has been heavily involved in many different climate- and energy-policy initiatives, including as convening lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations-sanctioned international body with 195 country members that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. His Ph.D. is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and A.B. from Harvard University.

338,K7z6mxe7ej4,NASA Climate Change,The GMAO High-Resolution Coupled Model and Assimilation System for Seasonal Prediction,"The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) is about to release a new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Subseasonal to Seasonal prediction (S2S) system, GEOS-S2S-3, that represents an improvement in performance and infrastructure over the previous system, GEOS-S2S-2. The system will be described, including some features unique to GEOS-S2S, and the advantages of increases in resolution, upgrades in the model, expansion of data used for assimilation, and the change in ensemble perturbation strategy and ensemble size will be demonstrated. Results are presented from forecasts, climate equillibrium simulations, and data assimilation experiments. GEOS-S2S-3 will be used to produce a long term weakly coupled reanalysis called MERRA-2 Ocean.

The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean shows a reduction in systematic error relative to GEOS-S2S-2, attributed in part to an increase in ocean resolution and to the upgrade in the glacier runoff scheme. The GEOS-S2S-3 coupled reanalysis also shows improvements attributed to the assimilation of satellite surface salinity. The forecast skill shows improved prediction of the North Atlantic Oscillation, attributed to the increase in forecast ensemble members.

With the release of GEOS-S2S-3 and MERRA-2 Ocean, GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state-of-the-art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.

ABOUT THE LECTURER: Dr. Andrea Molod is a Physical Research Scientist at the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. She has been leading the GMAO’s Seasonal Prediction system group since 2016, overseeing the development of the coupled model, the weakly coupled data assimilation system and the ensemble forecasting strategy. Her focus for development has been the expansion of the model’s interactive components towards a complete earth system, and the inclusion of new data types in the assimilation. Dr. Molod originally joined the predecessor of the GMAO in 1985, and her work until recently primarily focused on understanding and modeling the processes that occur near the land/ocean surface and in the boundary layer. An integral part of her work continues to be the assessment and improvement of a GCM’s ability to predict the evolution of the earth’s weather and climate from synoptic to seasonal scales, functioning in atmosphere-only, coupled ocean/atmosphere, and data assimilation modes.

339,0d1vBXEURNI,NASA Climate Change,"A Machine Learning Approach Toward a “Seamless” Understanding Droughts, Heatwaves and Fire Weather","The National Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC) aims to improve earth system prediction from sub-seasonal to decade scales, with emphasis on “seamless” prediction. Yet, our understanding of weather-climate connection, especially in a changing climate, is still in its infancy. For example, it is not clear what weather patterns are responsible for dry spells and heat waves during the warm season over continental United States (US), and which of these patterns are responsible for extreme droughts and stronger and longer fire season? How do decadal climate variability and anthropogenic forced climate change affect the intensity and frequency of extreme fire weather?

In this lecture, I will report our recent and ongoing studies to explore these questions through machine learning approaches. To assess the influence of weather patterns on droughts and fire weather, we use multivariate Self-Organization Map to characterize the weather patterns responsible for dry and wet spells, their associated atmospheric thermodynamic condition and moisture transport, and their contributions to warm season droughts and decadal variability of the land surface aridity and fire weather. We also use a constructed flow analogue approach to determine the relative influence of natural climate variability and anthropogenic forced change on the increase of heatwaves and fire weather in recent decades over Western US, including those that contributed to the 2020 August Camp Fire, California’s largest wildfire on record.

The analyses suggest that, although many weather patterns can contribute to dry spells and moderate droughts, extreme droughts are largely caused by an increased frequency and persistence of a few leading weather patterns that are responsible for strong dry spells climatologically. Thus, understand the causes behind the changes of these few weather patterns is central for determining predictability of the extreme droughts. On the other hand, for the same weather patterns, the probability distributions of surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the recent decades have changed significantly over the western US, leading to higher probability of heatwaves and fire weather, compared to earlier decades. Consequently, at least two-thirds of the increase of the fire weather over western US during recent decades is attributable to climate change, whereas only one third or less of the increase of fire weather is attributable to changing weather patterns. Thus, climate variability and changes can have significant impact on weather and sub-seasonal forecasts.


ABOUT THE LECTURER: Dr. Rong Fu is a climate research and a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles. Her research focuses on the mechanisms that control droughts, rainfall seasonality and variability over Amazonian and North American regions, and how changes of global climate, local vegetation and biomass burning, and oceanic decadal variability have influenced these processes in the recent past and will influence rainfall seasonality and droughts in the future.

340,tLaWrofpFoU,NASA Climate Change,"Atmospheric Electricity, Lightning and Convection","Benjamin Franklin is considered to be the father of modern-day studies of atmospheric electricity, starting with his famous sentry box experiment in 1749. This clever but risky experiment demonstrated that convective clouds are electrified, yet, even today, there is not a complete theory for how electrified clouds lead to lightning. In this talk I will first discuss the role of thunderstorms in maintaining the global circuit. Some have argued that long term monitoring of the global circuit can yield information about climate change. Current theories for cloud electrification will then be summarized. Charge structures and lightning flash rates as measured by Very High Frequency (VHF) Lightning Mapping Arrays will be presented, leading to a discussion of how lightning is tied to cloud dynamical and microphysical processes. Finally, data from the new Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) will be discussed, in particular for so called “electrically inverted” storms. I will also touch on land-ocean lightning differences and the sensitivity of convection to increasing aerosol concentrations.

341,uNpAQnaTZX0,NASA Climate Change,The Intersections between COVID and Climate Change,"The COVID-19 Pandemic has turned most of the world upside down in 2020. COVID-19 related shutdowns have resulted in significant changes in anthropogenic emissions in 2020. We use estimates of COVID-19 mitigation related emissions changes in an Earth System Model to tease out COVID related impacts across timescales, starting with impacts of aviation reductions on daily weather and climate, to local and global air quality and composition impacts of regional and global emissions changes, to the direct and indirect radiative forcing associated with emissions changes. Using a hierarchy of model approaches we are able to separate signal to noise, and show small but quantifiable impacts on the earth system, equivalent to rolling back up to a decade worth of emissions increases. And finally, there are some interesting similarities between models of climate and pandemics, and how we understand uncertainty in models.

342,TctFCL0fDLk,NASA Climate Change,Ocean imprints: Small-scale air-sea interactions and ocean-weather climate connections,"The transfer of energy between the ocean and atmosphere drives global weather patterns and climate variability, as the ocean contains close to 97% of Earth’s water and has absorbed more than 90% of the excess heating in the Earth system. These air-sea interactions are critical to large-scale weather and climate predictions because of the ocean’s ability to absorb the excess atmospheric heat and carbon and regulate exchanges of momentum, water vapor and heat between the ocean and atmosphere. In this talk I will discuss how the ocean impacts our weather and climate systems, and what we do and don’t know about our air-sea interactions, with a focus on the impact of largely upsampled small-scale variability. I will also talk about what changes we have seen in the last few decades, and discuss how these changes are affecting water moving through the ocean, atmosphere, land and back again. There are still gaps in our knowledge of this complicated part of our climate system, and we will talk about unknowns and new observations, models, and forecasts that are being developed to help us improve predictability for weather and climate information.

350,AmSovbt5Bho,NASA Climate Change,Antarctic Ice Mass Loss 2002-2020,"The Antarctic ice sheet's mass has changed over the last decades. Research based on satellite data indicates that between 2002 and 2020, Antarctica shed approximately 150 billion metric tons of ice per year, adding to global sea level rise.

These images, created from GRACE and GRACE-FO data, show changes in Antarctic ice mass since 2002. Orange and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002.

Areas in East Antarctica experienced modest amounts of mass gain due to increased snow accumulation. However, this gain is more than offset by significant ice mass loss on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (dark red) over the 19-year period. Floating ice shelves whose mass change GRACE and GRACE-FO do not measure are colored gray.

The average flow lines (gray; created from satellite radar interferometry) of Antarctica’s ice converge into the locations of prominent outlet glaciers, and coincide with areas of highest mass loss (i.e., Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West-Antarctica). This supports other observations that warming ocean waters around Antarctica play a key role in contemporary ice mass loss.

Research based on satellite data indicates that between 2002 and 2020, Greenland shed approximately 280 billion metric tons of ice per year, adding to global sea level rise.

These images, created from GRACE and GRACE-FO data, show changes in Greenland ice mass since 2002. Orange and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002.

In general, higher-elevation areas near the center of Greenland experienced little to no change, while lower-elevation and coastal areas experienced over 16.4 feet (5 meters) of ice mass loss (expressed in equivalent-water-height; dark red) over this 19-year period. The largest mass decreases occurred along the West Greenland coast.

The average flow lines (gray; created from satellite radar interferometry) of Greenland’s ice converge into the locations of prominent outlet glaciers and coincide with areas of highest mass loss. This supports other observations that warming ocean waters around Greenland play a key role in contemporary ice mass loss.

Since there are no direct global observations of carbon's flow between different parts of the planet, scientists use models to provide that information from various indirect data sources.

This animation shows results from one such model (the ECCO-Darwin ocean biogeochemistry model). The video shows the movement of carbon dioxide between the air and sea with the help of ocean surface winds from Jan. 3, 2012 to Aug. 15, 2012. Blue colors indicate the ocean's uptake of CO2, and red colors indicate the ocean's release of CO2. The pathlines indicate surface winds, which help drive the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and ocean.

356,PSJRymZ5bJs,NASA Climate Change,Global Ocean Tides,"Ocean tides are not simple. If our planet had no continents, tides would be hemispheric-sized bulges of water moving westward with the moon and sun. This animation shows the tides as a complex system of rotating and trapped waves with a mixture of frequencies. Waves run relatively unimpeded westward only around Antarctica. Even there, we see a complicated pattern as waves merge from the north and others separate northwards or southwards under Antarctic ice shelves.

In the North Atlantic, we see waves mainly rotating anti-clockwise, with small amplitudes in the middle of the ocean and high amplitudes around the boundaries, especially along the coasts of northwest Europe and Britain. Waves are trapped and rotating around New Zealand, causing a high tide on one side of the islands with a simultaneous low tide on the other side.

The Topex/Poseidon and Jason satellite altimeter missions were designed to observe and record this complexity. Altimeters on these missions acted as flying tide gauges. After several years collecting data, researchers could analyze the signals at each ocean location to determine the tidal characteristics. With that knowledge, plus near-perfect knowledge of the motion of the sun and moon, the tide can be predicted at any location and at any time in the future.

The data used in this visualization run for slightly longer than one Earth day. The level of the tides is exaggerated in order to show how the tides vary around the world.

358,OfMsX2ZHABM,NASA Climate Change,"Ocean Flows Under Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica","Glaciers surrounding the Amundsen Sea in Antarctica have been rapidly melting. As glaciers flow out from land to the ocean, large expanses of ice behind their leading edges float on the seawater. The point on a glacier where it first loses contact with land is called the grounding line. Nearly all glacier melt occurs on the underside of the glacier beyond the grounding line, on the section floating on seawater as the warmer ocean currents erode the base of the floating ice.

This visualization shows ocean currents circulating Pine Island Bay and flowing under Pine Island Glacier. The visualization approaches the glacier, dives beneath the water, and views the ocean flows circulating beneath the floating ice. For more clarity, the surface of the ice sheet is exaggerated by 4x while the topography below sea level is exaggerated by 15x.

359,Vv6DOLdWWRM,NASA Climate Change,Understanding the Warming Arctic,"While the representation of physical processes in climate models has become more sophisticated over the last 30+ years, the vertical and seasonal fingerprints of Arctic greenhouse warming have not changed. Are the models right? Observations in recent decades show the same fingerprints: surface amplified warming especially in late fall and winter. Recent observations show no summer cloud response to Arctic sea ice loss, but increased cloud cover and a deepening atmospheric boundary layer in fall. Taken together, clouds appear to not affect the fingerprints of Arctic warming. The interconnected positive surface albedo feedback and positive lapse rate feedback rule. Can we check the models? Having observations alone does not enable robust model evaluation and model improvement. Comparing models and observations is hard enough but to improve models, one must make credible comparisons, understand why models and observations differ, and improve the physics. It’s all a tall order, but recent progress is summarized here.

360,q7OfMoMxkYg,NASA Climate Change,Is cloud dynamics impossibly complex or fundamentally simple?,"In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson posed the dream of using a grid of prognostic equations to accurately compute future weather before it arrives. But while weather predictability has been realized, and despite tremendous improvements in computational speed and physical understanding, we have been less successful at constraining the future role of clouds in climate. The general scientific strategy for tackling the problem has been to model clouds using Richardson’s deterministic concept for weather. But does this make the most sense? I will discuss an alternative time-independent approach where, statistically speaking, the complex geometries of tropical convective cloud fields can be seen to “emerge” from a point value of the bulk tropospheric stability. Circulations around cloud edge compete with each other for total buoyant energy and air, and this constrains both total cloud amount and the distributions of cloud sizes. Theoretical predictions are in close agreement with a detailed LES tropical cloud field simulation of one billion grid points, and with Oxygen A-band satellite retrievals over the tropics. Possible implications for cloud distributions and cover in a warmer climate will be explored.

This leads to slowly-evolving spatial modulations of surface buoyancy and momentum fluxes that generate ""secondary circulations"" in both media near the air-sea interface, with net climate effects both in oceanic eddy energy level and, potentially, in marine cloud pattern formation.

The visualization presented here shows the complex patterns of methane emissions produced globally between January 2018 and November 2018 from different sources.

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that traps heat 28 times more effectively than carbon dioxide over a 100-year timescale. Concentrations of methane have increased by more than 150% since industrial activities and intensive agriculture began. After carbon dioxide, methane was responsible for about 23% of climate change in the 20th century.

Methane is produced under conditions where little to no oxygen is available. About 30% of methane emissions are produced by wetlands, including ponds, lakes, and rivers. Another 20% is produced by agriculture, due to a combination of livestock, waste management and rice cultivation. Activities related to oil, gas, and coal extraction release an additional 30%.

The remainder of methane emissions come from minor sources such as wildfire, biomass burning, permafrost, termites, dams, and the ocean. Scientists around the world are working to better understand the budget of methane with the ultimate goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving prediction of environmental change. For additional information, see the Global Methane Budget: https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/methanebudget/index.htm and NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4799.

When the global COVID-19 pandemic forced social distancing among the development teams, the challenge was how to keep making progress on this extremely important research initiative, even though most engineers and others involved with the mission's development could not actually work together in fabrication areas.


It turns out that the extraordinary team bring PACE to life were not about to give up their goals, and in this video, we hear from a range of NASA pros talk about how to keep going, keep standards high, and see their plans through even the most challenging of circumstances.

Similar reductions in air pollution have been observed in other regions of the world. These recent improvements in air quality have come at a high cost, as communities grapple with widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders as a result of the spread of COVID-19.

One air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels (diesel, gasoline, coal), coming out of our tailpipes when driving cars and smokestacks when generating electricity. Therefore, changes in NO2 levels can be used as an indicator of changes in human activity.

Sea surface temperature (water temperature at the sea's surface, where the ocean is in direct contact with the atmosphere) plays a large role in climate and weather. For example, every 3 to 7 years, a swath of the Pacific Ocean along the equator warms by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit). This warming is a hallmark of the climate pattern El Niño, which changes rainfall patterns around the globe, causing heavy rainfall in the southern United States and severe drought in Australia, Indonesia and southern Asia.

On a smaller scale, ocean temperatures influence the development of tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons), which draw energy from warm ocean waters to form and intensify.

377,RhpKYVGzhRY,NASA Climate Change,NASA Mission Maps 16 Years of Ice Loss,"Using the most advanced Earth-observing laser instrument NASA has ever flown in space, scientists have made precise, detailed measurements of how the elevation of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have changed over 16 years.


The results provide insights into how the polar ice sheets are changing, demonstrating definitively that small gains of ice in East Antarctica are dwarfed by massive losses in West Antarctica. The scientists found the net loss of ice from Antarctica, along with Greenland’s shrinking ice sheet, has been responsible for 0.55 inches (14 millimeters) of sea level rise between 2003 and 2019 – slightly less than a third of the total amount of sea level rise observed in the world’s oceans.

378,54ECqX2tq9k,NASA Climate Change,NASA Models the Complex Chemistry of Earth's Atmosphere,"Air pollution can appear as a gray or orange haze enveloping a city. What the naked eye can’t see are the hundreds of chemical reactions taking place to produce that pollution. NASA science can reveal a more complete picture of atmospheric chemistry.

A NASA visualization shows 96 chemical species that help form one common air pollutant — surface ozone. While ozone in the stratosphere is critical to maintaining life on earth, surface ozone is a toxic gas to most plant and animal species. This visualization uses the GEOS Composition Forecasting (GEOS-CF) computer model, which incorporates 240 chemical species and how they interact with each other and the weather through over 700 chemical reactions. All of these chemical reactions directly or indirectly impact the formation of ozone.

Capturing such complexity requires satellites, the GEOS-CF model, and a supercomputer all working in concert. As the visualization progresses, it cycles through chemicals loosely grouped into seven ‘families’ based on their physical and chemical properties:
• Ox
• Extended HOx family
• Hydrocarbons
• Isoprene oxidation
• Aerosols
• Halogens
• Extended NOx family

More information on each family can be found on the visualization webpage: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4754.

The dynamic behavior of some of these chemical species can indicate certain events in the atmosphere. The model covers the time period from July 22, 2018 to October 2, 2018, which includes several notable atmospheric events. Both the Carr Fire and the Mendocino Complex Fire, occurring in late July 2018, released a large amount of hydrocarbons and extended HOx, which can be seen in the model. The latter-occurring Hurricane Florence is also visible, as indicated by the impacted halogens in this atmospheric model.

Satellites observe chemical species in the atmosphere, both those emitted from natural and human sources and those formed from other pollutants. Yet, even several hundred thousand observations a day leave data gaps. Merging satellite data with NASA’s GEOS-CF model yields not only a snapshot of chemistry throughout the atmosphere at any given time but also the ability to predict air quality worldwide.

This model makes a 5-day forecast daily using the NASA Center for Climate Simulation’s Discover supercomputer: https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/. Developed jointly with several government and non-profit partners, these forecasts offer a new tool for academic researchers, government scientists, air quality managers, and the general public. Potential applications include flight campaign planning, support of satellite observations, and mitigation of air pollution.

379,e3LgBYNjr4c,NASA Climate Change,Salty Motion,"The saltiness of the sea surface varies depending on where and when you're looking. Heavy rainfall, river outflows, ocean currents, sea ice melt, evaporation and other seasonal phenomena can all alter salinity—and scientists can now see these changes in clear detail.

NASA's Aquarius mission has collected the agency's first full year of satellite ocean surface salinity measurements, revealing a colorful and dynamic portrait of our salty seas.

Salinity shifts, a powerful driver of global ocean currents, are also a fingerprint of variations in Earth's fresh water cycle, providing valuable information on how a changing climate is altering global rainfall patterns.

Before Aquarius, researchers had only snapshots of the ocean's salt content variations. With global satellite measurements, they will now be able to see how salinity changes over time. Watch the video to learn more about our ocean's salty motions.

Different aerosols are highlighted by color, including dust (orange), sea salt (blue), nitrates (pink) and carbonaceous (red), with brighter regions corresponding to higher aerosol amounts.

The local impacts of the Australian bushfires have been devastating to property and life in Australia, while producing extreme air quality impacts throughout the region.

As smoke from the massive fires has interacted with global weather, the transport of smoke plumes around the globe has accelerated into the upper troposphere and even the lowermost stratosphere, leading to long-range transport around the globe.

The smoke from these bushfires will travel across the Southern Ocean, completing a global circumnavigation back around to Australia, and is particularly pronounced across the southern Pacific Ocean out to South America.

The Arctic sea ice cap is an expanse of frozen seawater floating on top of the Arctic Ocean and neighboring seas. Every year, it expands and thickens during the fall and winter and grows smaller and thinner during the spring and summer.

But in the past decades, increasing temperatures have caused marked decreases in the Arctic sea ice extents in all seasons, with particularly rapid reductions in the minimum end-of-summer ice extent. The shrinking of the Arctic sea ice cover can ultimately affect local ecosystems, global weather patterns, and the circulation of the oceans.

402,fNBkqOmdT4g,NASA Climate Change,Methane in the Climate System: Monitoring Emissions from Satellites,"The climate forcing from methane emissions since pre-industrial times has been 60% of that from CO2, meaning that methane has made a large contribution to observed warming over the past century. However, the climate impact of methane emissions is very different than that of CO2 emissions in terms of time scales, and this must be recognized when setting climate policy targets: use of a single climate metric to compare the effects of methane and CO2 emissions is not appropriate. An additional complication is that methane is emitted by a variety of sources, and there is large uncertainty in the contribution of different source regions and sectors to the overall methane budget. The recent decadal uptick in methane has generated much interest and is still unexplained. Satellites offer considerable potential for global monitoring of methane emissions, quantifying the contributions from different sources, detecting temporal variability, and attributing long-term trends. Atmospheric methane has been measured continuously from space since 2003, and new instruments have been recently launched or are planned for launch in the near future that will greatly expand the capabilities of space-based observations. I will discuss the value of these observations to better quantify and monitor methane emissions, from the global scale down to the scale of point sources.

404,X97BPLwTVMk,NASA Climate Change,Energetic Constraints on Model Errors in Precipitation,"Climate models can have significant errors in global precipitation, particularly for the tropics. In his talk, Professor Jakob will explain how likely the climate model rainfall errors in the tropics are the result of errors in radiative cooling due to the misrepresentation of tropical cirrus and/or subtropical boundary layer clouds ,as they are the result of errors in the cumulus parametrization.

Professor Christian Jakob is the Professor for Climate Modelling at Monash University. His career has focused on advancing our understanding of the role of the tropics in the Earth’s energy and water cycles. In particular, he developed new approaches for the representation of tropical convective systems in weather and climate models. He has contributed to the development of several of the major weather and climate models across the globe.

Low soil and air moisture make it easier for fires to spread quickly. In these conditions, a spark from lightning, electrical failures, human error or planned fires can quickly get out of control. As Earth’s climate warms and precipitation patterns change, increasingly severe droughts will leave some areas of the world vulnerable to increasingly severe fires. Understanding how fires behave in dry conditions can help firefighters, first responders and others prepare for a hotter, drier future.

Snow and glaciers in these mountains contain the largest volume of freshwater outside of Earth's polar ice sheets, leading hydrologists to nickname this region the Third Pole. 

Rapid changes in the region's climate are affecting glacier flows and snowmelt. Local people are already modifying their land-use practices in response to the changing supply, and the region's ecology is transforming. Scientists estimate that by 2100, these glaciers could be up to 75% smaller in volume. 

NASA's satellites observe and measure snow and ice cover remotely with multiple types of sensors. This allows scientists to create an authoritative estimate of the water budget of this region and a set of products local policy makers can use in responding to hazards and planning for a changing water supply.

409,QtUmj5z2vCk,NASA Climate Change,Modeling the Future of the Greenland Ice Sheet,"Scientists at the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Geophysical Institute used data from NASA’s Operation IceBridge to develop a more accurate model of how the Greenland Ice Sheet might respond to climate change in the future, finding that it could generate more sea level rise than previously thought.

In the next 50 years, the model shows that melting at the present rate could contribute one to four inches to global sea level rise. This number jumps to five to13 inches by 2100 and 19 to 63 inches by 2200. These numbers are considerably higher than previous estimates, which forecasted up to 35 inches of sea level rise by 2200.

The updated model is the first to include outlet glaciers — river-like bodies of ice that connect to the ocean. Outlet glaciers play a key role in how ice sheets melt, but previous models lacked the data to adequately represent their complex flow patterns. The study found that melting outlet glaciers could account for up to 40% of the ice mass lost from Greenland in the next 200 years.

By incorporating ice thickness data from IceBridge and identifying sources of statistical uncertainty within the model, the study creates a more accurate picture of how human-generated greenhouse gas emissions and a warming climate may affect Greenland in the future.

He is known for advancing our understanding of the role of fires in the Earth System. In his work, he combines satellite observations with climate models to explore changes in the biosphere. In 2003, Randerson moved to UC Irvine where he now holds the position of Ralph J. and Carol M. Cicerone Professor of Earth System Science.

Carbon cycle feedbacks have the potential to accelerate the build up of atmospheric carbon dioxide, making it more difficult to stabilize the climate system. In his talk, Professor Randerson will describe several terrestrial carbon cycle feedback mechanisms involving lightning, wildfires and sea level rise that are likely to become increasingly important over a period of decades to centuries. Within the oceans, Professor Randerson will discuss how changes in sea ice cover around Antarctica may trigger sustained losses of global ocean productivity and fisheries for more than a millennium.

Throughout her research career she has developed and used complex weather and climate models to understand the climate system and to predict its evolution. Her special
interests are in tropical weather and climate variability, understanding their influence on the global climate system and their role in monthly to decadal climate prediction.

Climate change will be one of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century; how we respond will determine our future prosperity, health and well-being and the sustainability of Earth’s natural environment. However, these responses must be underpinned by the best possible climate science to ensure that we make wise decisions on how to build resilience to weather and climate extremes, and adapt to and mitigate climate change.

In this talk, Dame Julia Slingo will discuss the history of our understanding of how the climate system works, how this understanding has been embedded in the development of climate models, and how we use these models now to guide our actions to deliver a safe and sustainable future.

413,MwDzXed8JEQ,NASA Climate Change,Severe Thunderstorms and Climate – a JPL Center for Climate Sciences Presentation,"Severe thunderstorms, which are often associated with strong winds, hail, and tornadoes, pose substantial threats to people, livestock, and agriculture. While their dynamics are well understood, relatively little is known about how climate change (man‐made or natural) might affect such storms. In this talk I will focus on one of the main environmental prerequisites for severe storms: Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), which is a measure of the potential energy stored in moist atmospheres that can be released explosively when the potential energy barrier that permits its accumulation breaks. I will discuss the work of my former PhD student that shows, rather unexpectedly, that CAPE usually accumulates over only the 6‐8 hours leading up to the storm and that its build‐up is strongly controlled by soil moisture. I will present observational evidence for this as well as a very simple theoretical model, and discuss how climate change should affect CAPE and how the new understanding of CAPE may someday allow for seasonal prediction of severe storm activity.

414,gawMK1baOb0,NASA Climate Change,Human Influence on Global Droughts Goes Back 100 Years,"Human-generated greenhouse gases and atmospheric particles were affecting global drought risk as far back as the early 20th century, according to a study from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City. 

The study, published in the journal Nature, compared predicted and real-world soil moisture data to look for human influences on global drought patterns in the 20th century. Climate models predict that a human “fingerprint” – a global pattern of regional drying and wetting characteristic of the climate response to greenhouse gases – should be visible early in the 1900’s and increase over time as emissions increased. Using observational data such as precipitation and historical data reconstructed from tree rings, the researchers found that the real-world data began to align with the fingerprint within the first half of the 20th century. 

The team said the study is the first to provide historical evidence connecting human-generated emissions and drought at near-global scales, lending credibility to forward-looking models that predict such a connection. According to the new research, the fingerprint is likely to grow stronger over the next few decades, potentially leading to severe human consequences.

However, Antarctica’s additional ice mass gained from snowfall only makes up for about a third of its current ice loss.

These findings don’t necessarily mean that Antarctica is growing; it’s still losing mass, even with the extra snowfall.

However, without these gains, the planet would have experienced even more sea level rise in the 20th century.

The polar ice sheets grow via snow accumulation and shrink through melting and the production of icebergs.

Presently, both ice sheets are imbalanced – losing more ice annually than they are gaining – and their ice loss is estimated to be currently causing about a half of the observed sea level rise.

Video transcript:
What's the difference between weather and climate?
Take a look outside your window.
Is it hot and sunny?
Is it cloudy and rainy?
Is there snow on the ground?
When you look out the window, you’re seeing what the weather is like today.
Weather is only temporary. For example, a blizzard can turn into a flood after just a few warm spring days.
Climate, on the other hand, is more than just a few warm or cool days.
Climate describes the typical weather conditions in an entire region for a very long time—30 years or more.
Keeping an eye on changing weather can help us plan ahead.
We know that if thunderclouds are forming overhead, it’s probably a good idea to stay inside.
But it’s important to keep an eye on changes in Earth’s climate, too. And NASA has observed that Earth is getting warmer.
Keeping track of Earth’s sea level is one way that we can know how quickly the climate is changing.
As Earth’s climate warms, ice in Antarctica and Greenland is melting. This causes the level of the oceans to rise.
NASA satellites can measure sea level rise from space.
They can also track changes in the climate by measuring the clouds.
We know that changes in the number, size or location of clouds could be caused by a change in Earth’s climate.
NASA satellites are always orbiting Earth, looking down at our oceans and clouds. And they monitor Earth’s climate in other ways, too.
It’s important to keep an eye on our planet and all the ways that it’s changing. Right now, it’s the only one we’ve got!

A new NASA-funded study focuses on a mechanism that could accelerate the release of this atmospheric carbon, the result of thermokarst lakes. These lakes form when thawing permafrost causes the ground to slump, creating a depression that collects rain and snowmelt and perpetuates a cycle of further permafrost thaw.

Ocean circulation at the Antarctic margins is dominated by a system of circumpolar frontal currents that occupy the continental shelf and slope.  This Antarctic Slope Frontal (ASF) system has a significant impact on global climate through its control over the transport of warm water towards Antarctica's floating ice shelves and over the properties of bottom waters exported from the Antarctic shelf.  In the past two decades, appreciation of the spatial and temporal variability of the ASF and its impact on heat and tracer transport has grown through a combination of novel in situ observational techniques, remote sensing and high-resolution numerical modeling.  This talk will highlight how these different approaches have improved our dynamical understanding of the ASF and its role in the global circulation and climate system.

439,Z_9WbrPCMbc,NASA Climate Change,NASA studies an unusual Arctic warming event,"Winter temperatures are soaring in the Arctic for the fourth winter in a row. The heat, accompanied by moist air, is entering the Arctic not only through the sector of the North Atlantic Ocean that lies between Greenland and Europe, as it has done in previous years, but is also coming from the North Pacific through the Bering Strait.

“We have seen winter warming events before, but they’re becoming more frequent and more intense,” said Alek Petty, a sea ice researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Scientists are waiting to see how much this heat wave will impact the wintertime sea ice maximum extent, which has been shrinking in the past decades and has hit record lows each of the past three years. The sea ice levels are already at record lows or near-record lows in several areas of the Arctic. Another exceptional event this winter is the opening up of the sea ice cover north of Greenland, releasing heat from the ocean to the atmosphere and making the sea ice more vulnerable to further melting.

“This is a region where we have the thickest multi-year sea ice and expect it to not be mobile, to be resilient,” Petty said. “But now this ice is moving pretty quickly, pushed by strong southerly winds and probably affected by the warm temperatures, too.”

Continuing the planet’s long-term warming trend, globally averaged temperatures in 2017 were 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.90 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1951 to 1980 mean, according to scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. That is second only to global temperatures in 2016. Last year was the third consecutive year in which temperatures were more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) above late nineteenth-century levels.

NASA’s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from 6,300 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. 

These raw measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heating effects that could skew the conclusions. These calculations produce the global average temperature deviations from the baseline period of 1951 to 1980.

The full 2017 surface temperature data set and the complete methodology used to make the temperature calculation are available at http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/.

GISS is a laboratory within the Earth Sciences Division of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The laboratory is affiliated with Columbia University’s Earth Institute and School of Engineering and Applied Science in New York.

This absorption can help mitigate the early effects of human-emissions of carbon dioxide.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation acts as a conveyor belt of ocean water from Florida to Greenland. Along the journey north, water near the surface absorbs greenhouse gases, which sink down as the water cools near Greenland. In this way, the ocean effectively buries the gases deep below the surface.

454,aWqjqLFmQnA,NASA Climate Change,Seasonal changes in carbon dioxide,"Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere through human activities. It is also influenced by natural exchange with the land and ocean. This visualization provides a high-resolution, three-dimensional view of global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015. The visualization was created using output from the GEOS modeling system, developed and maintained by scientists at NASA. The height of Earth’s atmosphere and topography have been vertically exaggerated and appear approximately 400 times higher than normal to show the complexity of the atmospheric flow. Measurements of carbon dioxide from NASA’s second Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) spacecraft are incorporated into the model every 6 hours to update, or “correct,” the model results, called data assimilation.

As the visualization shows, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can be mixed and transported by winds in the blink of an eye. For several decades, scientists have measured carbon dioxide at remote surface locations and occasionally from aircraft. The OCO-2 mission represents an important advance in the ability to observe atmospheric carbon dioxide. OCO-2 collects high-precision, total column measurements of carbon dioxide (from the sensor to Earth’s surface) during daylight conditions. While surface, aircraft, and satellite observations all provide valuable information about carbon dioxide, these measurements do not tell us the amount of carbon dioxide at specific heights throughout the atmosphere or how it is moving across countries and continents. Numerical modeling and data assimilation capabilities allow scientists to combine different types of measurements (e.g., carbon dioxide and wind measurements) from various sources (e.g., satellites, aircraft, and ground-based observation sites) to study how carbon dioxide behaves in the atmosphere and how mountains and weather patterns influence the flow of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Scientists can also use model results to understand and predict where carbon dioxide is being emitted and removed from the atmosphere and how much is from natural processes and human activities.

Carbon dioxide variations are largely controlled by fossil fuel emissions and seasonal fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere and land biosphere. For example, dark red and orange shades represent regions where carbon dioxide concentrations are enhanced by carbon sources. During Northern Hemisphere fall and winter, when trees and plants begin to lose their leaves and decay, carbon dioxide is released in the atmosphere, mixing with emissions from human sources. This, combined with fewer trees and plants removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, allows concentrations to climb all winter, reaching a peak by early spring. During Northern Hemisphere spring and summer months, plants absorb a substantial amount of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, thus removing it from the atmosphere and change the color to blue (low carbon dioxide concentrations). This three-dimensional view also shows the impact of fires in South America and Africa, which occur with a regular seasonal cycle. Carbon dioxide from fires can be transported over large distances, but the path is strongly influenced by large mountain ranges like the Andes. Near the top of the atmosphere, the blue color indicates air that last touched the Earth more than a year before. In this part of the atmosphere, called the stratosphere, carbon dioxide concentrations are lower because they haven’t been influenced by recent increases in emissions.

NASA's fleet of 18 Earth science missions in space, supported by aircraft, ships and ground observations, measure aspects of the environment that touch the lives of every person around the world. They study everything from the air we breathe, to rain and snow that provide water for agriculture and communities, to natural disasters such as droughts and floods, to the oceans, which cover 70 percent of Earth’s surface and provide food for many people around the world. Satellites and instruments on the International Space Station circle the whole globe, seeing both where people live and those remote parts of deserts, mountains and the vast oceans that are difficult if not impossible to visit. With instruments in space, scientists can get data for the whole globe in detail that they can't get anywhere else. This visualization shows the NASA fleet in 2017, from low Earth orbit all the way out to the DSCOVR satellite taking in the million-mile view.

With imagery and data from Landsat 8, a joint mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, scientists are providing a near-real-time view of every large glacier and ice sheet on Earth. Researchers aim to better understand how ice flow is changing worldwide by integrating information about atmosphere and ocean conditions to determine what causes these ice sheets to change — and what that means for how much ice is flowing into the ocean. That could help provide critical information to coastal communities that will be most impacted by sea level rise. The Heimdal glacier in Southeast Greenland shown here can travel more than 33 feet (10 meters) per day in early summer and less than 20 feet (6 meters) per day by October.

The gas is released from human activities like burning fossil fuels, and the concentration of carbon dioxide moves and changes through the seasons. 

Using observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) satellite, scientists developed a model of the behavior of carbon in the atmosphere from September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015. 

Scientists can use models like this one to better understand and predict where concentrations of carbon dioxide could be especially high or low, based on activity on the ground.

The height of Earth’s atmosphere and topography have been vertically exaggerated and appear approximately 40 times higher than normal to show the complexity of the atmospheric flow.

Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean. This makes 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures. 

The 2016 temperatures continue a long-term warming trend, according to analyses by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. NOAA scientists concur with the finding that 2016 was the warmest year on record based on separate, independent analyses of the data.

This color-coded map displays a progression of changing global surface temperatures anomalies from 1880 through 2016. The final frame represents global temperature anomalies averaged from 2012 through 2016 in degrees Celsius.

To learn more about it, NASA, as the agency with access to space, was tasked with launching the first weather satellite back in 1960. Today, NASA uses satellites, aircraft and even an occasional boat to study our planet's air, land and water. It's called ""Earth System Science"" and we are trying to answer some big questions: How is the global Earth system changing? What causes these changes? How will Earth change in the future? And what we learn benefits society through applications such as weather forecasting, freshwater availability and disaster response.

These tiny particles affect weather and climate, cause hazy skies and can pose serious health hazards. Aerosols also can act as sites for chemical reactions, such as those that lead to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, i.e., the ozone hole.

463,8auMIfF50Ng,NASA Climate Change,Weekly Arctic sea ice age between 1984 and 2016,"One significant change in the Arctic region in recent years has been the rapid decline in perennial sea ice. Perennial sea ice, also known as multi-year ice, is the portion of the sea ice that survives the summer melt season. Perennial ice may have a life-span of nine years or more and represents the thickest component of the sea ice; perennial ice can grow up to 4 meters thick. By contrast, first year ice that grows during a single winter is generally at most 2 meters thick.

Below is an animation of the weekly sea ice age between 1984 and 2016. The animation shows the seasonal variability of the ice, growing in the Arctic winter and melting in the summer. In addition, this also shows the changes from year to year, depicting the age of the sea ice in different colors. Younger sea ice, or first-year ice, is shown in a dark shade of blue, while the ice that is at least four years old is shown as white. A color scale identifies the age of the intermediary years.

A graph in the lower right corner quantifies the change over time by showing the area in millions of square kilometers covered by each age category of perennial sea ice. This graph also includes a memory bar — the green line that represents the current maximum value seen thus far in the animation for the particular week displayed. For example, when showing the first week in September, the memory bar will show the maximum value seen for all prior years' first week of September since the beginning of the animation (January 1, 1984).

Windblown dust, sea salts, sulfates, smoke from wildfires and pollution from factories are all examples of aerosols. Depending upon their size, type and location, aerosols can either cool the Earth's surface or warm it. They can help clouds form or inhibit cloud formation. And if inhaled, some aerosols can be harmful to people’s health.

To study aerosols and their impact on clouds, researchers from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office ran a simulation of the atmosphere that captured how winds transport aerosols around the world. This simulation, produced by the Goddard Earth Observing System Model Version 5 (GEOS -5), shows clouds (white), dust (brown shades), sulfates (purple shades) and organic black carbon (green shades) at 7-kilometer resolution from September 1, 2005, to December 31, 2005 (hourly). Simulations like this allow scientists to better understand how different types of aerosols travel in the atmosphere, impact cloud formation and influence weather and climate.

NASA’s versatile DC-8 flying laboratory has been fitted out with an array of complex science instruments to collect data that will help advance the ability to monitor air pollution from space. Findings from KORUS-AQ will help scientists develop a new international atmospheric observing system to provide improved air quality assessments.

Take a walk through the DC-8 during its first KORUS-AQ science flight as technicians and scientists work their instruments and watch the air quality data streaming in.

Major changes in water mass can cause localized bumps and dips in gravity, sometimes with counterintuitive effects. Melting glaciers, for example, actually cause nearby sea level to drop; as they lose mass, their gravitational pull slackens, and sea water migrates away. In this animation, computed from data gathered by the twin GRACE satellites between April 2002 and March 2015, sea level is dropping around rapidly melting Greenland (orange, yellow). But near coastlines at a sufficient distance, the added water causes sea levels to rise (blue). The computational method is described in Adhikari et al. (2016, Geoscientific Model Development). And, these solutions are presented in Adhikari and Ivins (2016, Science Advances).

496,DXogQ22x0X0,NASA Climate Change,West Antarctic Collapse (non-narrated),"A new study by researchers at NASA and the University of California, Irvine, finds a rapidly melting section of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appears to be in an irreversible state of decline, with nothing to stop the glaciers in this area from melting into the sea according to glaciologist and lead author Eric Rignot, of UC Irvine and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Three major lines of evidence point to the glaciers' eventual demise: the changes in their flow speeds, how much of each glacier floats on seawater, and the slope and depth of the terrain they are flowing over. In a paper in April, Rignot's research group discussed the steadily increasing flow speeds of these glaciers over the past 40 years. This new study examines the other two lines of evidence.

As glaciers flow out from land to the ocean, large expanses of ice behind their leading edges float on the seawater. The point on a glacier where it first loses contact with land is called the grounding line. Nearly all glacier melt occurs on the underside of the glacier beyond the grounding line, on the section floating on seawater. The Antarctic glaciers studied have thinned so much they are now floating above places where they used to sit solidly on land, which means their grounding lines are retreating inland.

Much of the world's population lives on or near the coast, and rising seas are something worth watching. Sea level can rise for two reasons, both linked to a warming planet. When ice on land, such as mountain glaciers or the ice sheets of Greenland or Antarctica, melt, that water contributes to sea level rise. And when our oceans get warmer - another indicator of climate change - the water expands, also making sea level higher. Using satellites, lasers, and radar in space, and dedicated researchers on the ground, NASA is studying the Earth's ice and water to better understand how sea level rise might affect us all.

512,Z3tZwbxRMGQ,NASA Climate Change,Greenland ice flow,"Greenland looks like a big pile of snow seen from space using a regular camera. But satellite radar interferometry helps us detect the motion of ice beneath the snow. Ice starts flowing from the flanks of topographic divides in the interior of the island, and increases in speed toward the coastline where it is channelized along a set of narrow, powerful outlet glaciers. In the east, these glaciers make their sinuous way through complex terrain at low speed. They form long floating extensions that deform slowly in the cold north. As we move toward sectors of higher snowfall in the northwest and centre west, ice flow speeds increase by nearly a factor 10, with many, smaller glaciers flowing straight down to the coastline at several kilometers per year. This complete description of ice motion was only made possible from the coordinated effort of four space agencies: the Japanese Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, the European Space Agency, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The data will help scientists improve their understanding of the dynamics of ice in Greenland and in projecting how the Greenland Ice Sheet will respond to climate change in the decades and centuries to come.

This animation shows how ice is naturally transported from interior topographic divides to the coast via glaciers. The colors represent the speed of ice flow, with areas in red and purple flowing the fastest at rates of kilometers per year. The vectors indicate the direction of flow.

519,8CvRc9JydCo,NASA Climate Change,Brazil’s extreme drought seen from space,"Empty water reservoirs, severe water rationing, and electrical blackouts are the new status quo in major cities across southeastern Brazil where the worst drought in 35 years has desiccated the region. A new NASA study estimates that the region has lost an average of 15 trillion gallons of water per year from 2012 to 2015. Eastern Brazil as a whole has lost on average 28 trillion gallons of water per year over the same time period.

Augusto Getirana, a hydrologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, analyzed the amount of water stored in aquifers and rivers across Brazil from 2002 to 2015, interested in understanding the depth of the current drought.

A new data visualization of 13 years of GRACE data shows the distribution of water across Brazil. Blues indicate increases in water, mostly occurring in the western regions of Brazil in the rainforest. Meanwhile red and orange shows where water stores have declined, occurring mainly in the north and southeast. At the beginning of the data collection, in 2002, Brazil was just coming out of a drought that began in 2000. A wet period followed until 2012 when dry conditions set in again due to a lack of precipitation and higher than usual temperatures, according to supplemental data.

Southeastern Brazil was hardest hit by drought conditions, said Getirana. To make matters worse, Brazil relies on rivers that feed into reservoirs and dams that generate about 75 percent of the electrical power for the country. By September 2014, for example, the Cantareira reservoir system that provides water for 8.8 million people in São Paulo's metro region reported that it was filled to 10.7 percent of its total capacity, a situation that has led to major water rationing.

If needed, a backup launch opportunity is available on the Western Range on Jan. 30 with the same launch window.

SMAP is the first U.S. Earth-observing satellite designed to collect global observations of surface soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state. High-resolution space-based measurements of soil moisture and whether the soil is frozen or thawed will give scientists a new capability to better predict natural hazards of extreme weather, climate change, floods and droughts, and will help reduce uncertainties in our understanding of Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles.

The mission will provide the most accurate and highest-resolution maps of soil moisture ever obtained, mapping the globe every two to three days from space for a least three years. The spacecraft's final circular polar orbit will be 426 miles (685 kilometers) at an inclination of 98.1 degrees.

Nine of the 10 warmest years since modern records began have now occurred since 2000, according to a global temperature analysis by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.

2014’s record-breaking warmth continues a long-term trend of a warming climate. The global average temperature has increased about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since 1880, with most of that warming occurring during the last three to four decades.

The warming trend is largely driven by the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused by human emissions.

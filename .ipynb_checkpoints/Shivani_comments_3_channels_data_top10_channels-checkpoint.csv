Your videos help to keep our eyes focused on the critical reasons why we need to co-create better solutions.  As individuals, communities, nations, and as residents on our one-and-only planet, we desperately need a much better accounting of our living energy currency, - not just an accounting of our monetary currency.\n\nThe currency of all life here on Earth is “living energy.”  The living energy in our soils, and water, is needed to give birth to the plants humans need for survival.  Without that living energy, our soils would become only dirt and sand. Without soil biology, it becomes only geology - like Mars.  The valuable living energy currency of individual human beings is being devalued, wasted, and diverted.  The accounting valuation of monetary currency, increasingly devalues our living energy currency.  Our currency accounting system does not reflect the reality of what it takes for humanity to co-creatively sustain human life, on our planet.  Our current currency strategy is increasingly moving to a self-destructive goal, of increasingly devaluing all living energy currency.  \n\nLike a doctor, who only sees the symptoms, and waits for the test results, for a diagnosis, we are all sharing an experience of the awkward transition time of conscious (rather than unconscious) ignorance.  It’s also a time just before beautiful transitions for healing and marvelous new discoveries.\n\nAll of our “living energy currency” (environmental and human) is being severely depleted by climate change.  Past, present and future examples of an Economics of Compassion have protected our most valuable living energy currency.  For our present, and our future, we need to find many more, and better ways, for our monetary currency to support, and not threaten, our living energy currency.  \n\nPersonally, I’d love to explore a possibility of an individually-initiated economic currency, which would better enable human co-creative living energy currency. Individually initiated economic currency would be a biomimicry of the way each cell in our body has some limited degree of autonomy.  I wrote about this idea in our TTWalks message board in 2012 and called it a Jobs-Card, or J-Card.  It’s still online for anyone interested in Googling it.  I think this would better enable individual responses to co-creatively support both an environmental and human Economics of Compassion. Without this J-Card enablement, most individual responses are disabled.

9,wfq72W3RP_o,"[""Is CO2 the earth's Thermostat?  \n\nCarbon dioxide has nothing to do with causing global warming. CO2 Is currently trace at 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible!  Also, bear in mind, that Water Vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas.  CO2 is only 5% of the earth's GHG; Water Vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.    Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El Nino) and oceans degas.  Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.  Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and Not a Thermostat."", 'This was good to mention the global warming benefits northern countries, we count too. Also if we eliminate global warming we will introduce another iced age. How much fun does that sound. ?', 'Katherine, despite your many great talks, I have to disagree with you (and probably most others) regarding CO2 being a pollutant.  Atmospheric pollutants are ""substances that accumulate in the air to a degree that is directly harmful to living organisms or to materials exposed to the air"".  CO2, at 420 ppm at present, does not \'directly\' harm living organisms exposed to the air. Rather, it helps warm the planet, and its the heat energy that is impacting negatively on living organisms.  CO2 is, after all, essential for all life on Earth.  We would not have O2 were it not for CO2 and the photosynthesis process. Plants came before all animals and insects, because it was CO2 that eventually provided enough O2 for animals to evolve.  CO2, prior to humans producing far too much through fossil fuels, helped keep Earth\'s climate in balance, around 15 degs. C.  Without GHGs, Earth\'s mean global temperature would hover around -20 degs. C, and life as we know it could not exist. \n\nFurthermore, water vapour, yes H2O, makes up about 50% of all GHGs. If global temperatures increased by 2 degs C, say from 15 to 17C, then H2O vapour would increased by almost 25%, which might be enough to put the climate over the top.  Therefore, if CO2 is a pollutant, then you must also include H2O vapour as a pollutant.  Where wpuld that leave you?  You should not lump CO2, H2O, and N2O in the same category of pollutants as CO,  SO2, and NO2.  I cannot fathom labelling something essential to all life as a pollutant!

The Earth\'s temperature very quickly spikes up 8 to 15 degrees Celcius, followed by at least 10,000 years of relatively stable warm temperatures.  This is then followed by a rapid decline in temperature leading to 80,000 to 90,000 years of glaciation where half of North America is covered by glaciers, during which time the Earth slowly gets colder.  Then the cycle repeats.  The last time we experienced rapid warming was about 11,000 years ago.  All of human civilization arose during this brief warm period, thanks in part to the fertile crescent in the Middle East making grains more available.\r\n\r\nWe should be in the cool-down phase by now, but anthropogenic greenhouse gases have at least temporarily delayed it.  It was predicted in the 1970s that we were entering a new ice age.  A period from 1500 to 1850 has been labeled ""the little ice age"", however, atmospheric CO2 levels started to go up in the 1800s.  Some have said that no matter what we do we can\'t avoid the next period of mass glaciation roughly 10,00 years from now, while others have suggested that we can delay it.  Previous ice ages have caused massive declines in the human population.\r\n\r\nThese temperature cycles are caused by the roughly 5 different Malankovich cycles aligning with each other to produce rapid warming.  These cycles affect the Earth\'s orbit and its axial tilt.  The Earth is currently halfway between its maximum tilt and its minimum tilt, which has a 41,000-year cycle.  At the maximum tilt, the glaciers melt more, reducing the Earth\'s albedo, which means that less sunlight is reflected into space.  The increasing temperatures cause the oceans to release more of their stored CO2 into the atmosphere, which creates a temporary positive feedback loop.  The warming effect of CO2 in the atmosphere is logarithmic, which means that it reaches a saturation point, producing a temporarily stable warm climate.\r\n\r\nI don\'t understand why the cycle is every 100,000 years instead of every 41,000 years, and the Wikipedia article talks about this being an ""issue"" that they don\'t understand.

13,nnMJedLHjpY,"['The challenge those of us that recognize the climate is, in fact, changing have with this “movement” is the dishonesty and alarmism displayed by those seeking to further their agenda, for political or financial gain, at the expense of the taxpayers. If this is not the case, why have so many environmental grievance hustlers been allowed to remain relevant , or even employed??? For example, Paul Ehrlich has received numerous awards, excelled at Stanford, and been revered as a climate change expert, despite every one of his projections failing to materialize; his great Die-Off prediction, or in ‘89 he said everyone will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years (2009 came and went), or the king of disinformation, hypocrisy, and reaping millions off his nonsense, the dud Al Gore, who, in 2008, claimed a scientist predicted an ice-free Arctic in 2013. Almost 10 years later, and… I could go on forever… AOC, Denis Hayes, Kenneth Watt, Senator Gaylord Nelson, Stephen Schneider, James Hansen, et al. \n\nThis is why most of America, at least those still possessing a functional prefrontal cortex, tune out at any mention of alarmist climate change rhetoric, and will do our part and lobby to minimize taxpayer expenditures that won’t achieve realistic, measurable, meaningful results.\n\nIn closing, why are we not holding those making wildly false projections accountable? They’re either incompetent, dishonest, or a combination of both, and it needs to be pointed out. For example, the alarmist queen AOC said, in ‘19, that the world is going to end in 12 years, unless we do “something”. So, in 2031, when we’re still here, why will nobody remember and hold her accountable for her statement from ‘19?!?!? \n\nI understand Prof. Hayhoe’s point about climate vs weather, but if the local meteorologist continually predicted a blizzard in the summer, how long would we tune in to that station??', ""Firstly the progressive warming claim is unsupported by surface temperature data for the period described. Secondly, you can't create energy or a lack of it by redirecting it with moving air masses.  If one lower latitude gets colder another most warm but haven't provided the other half of your argument. That deceiving the audience and unscientific, even dishonest."", 'Early On God  told the Israelis’, Disobedience with the Law will be the following; \r\n“The Lord will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess.  The Lord will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish.  The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron, The Lord will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed, “\r\nWhen Jesus was questioned by the Pharisees, “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, “Love the Lord you God with all you heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.  This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it:  Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” It appears Jesus came to redirect the chow to maintain close to God.  \r\nWithin Muslim sects it appears the Laws are to be enforced by the people at the initial guidance of their God “Allah” which generally is the same as the Israelites God ,”Lord”. The Islam Laws have very harsh consequences for not observing the laws. There does not seem to be much of the Global Curses that occur in the Holy Bible. \r\nRegarding how to handle the non -believers, Mosses indicates if they live in an area outside the promised land, they are to make an offer of peace. If they accept, then all the people in the area are to be made slaves.  If they refuse engage them in battle and lay siege to the city. When the Lord delivers the city to you, put the sword to all the men .  Everything else can be taken and used as plunder. \r\nAs for the nations the Lord promised and gave the Israelites , they were to completely destroy all the people and buildings, for otherwise  they will teach you to follow the detestable things they do in worshiping their  gods ,and you will sin against the Lord your God.\r\nJesus did not address the issue of how to handle the people who do not follow “the way” he indicates. He seemed to be more directed to how the humans could gain and continue to maintain a relationship to the Lord. \r\nSix hundred years plus, after Jesus, upon Muhammad’s death, many Muslims unfortunately abandoned his peace movement. They adopted the ways of the world, fighting for land and power. They built empires like everyone else. Many commandments of God were violated. While alive, Muhammad did participate in the killings of those who tried to kill him and in some battles for religious areas. This defensive action was acceptable under the Muslim beliefs. \r\nHowever, the excesses of those empires pale in comparison with the horror inflicted by modern nation-states, which gave us World War I, II and the Holocaust. The death toll in the millions, the widespread destruction of infrastructure, and the attacks on civilians continue to this day, for religious ends, secular, economic, and political reasons\r\nIn reality, jihad warfare proceeded according to commands of the Qur’an and Muhammad and caused the deaths of many millions in the 1,400-year history of Islam.\r\nExcept for the religious sects that want to have nations under the control of religious leadership, war has degenerated into guerrilla tactics due to the nuclear possibilities. \r\nSo economic pressures are more the tools of war today, and are used for political reasons for most part. It appears however that the Islamic nations are beginning to consider joining together in some sort of Calafat with an Islamic leadership  which can join together in economic war on the rest of the world. While still maintaining their nation’s individual political leadership and government. \r\nWill God bless the Jewish, Christian and Muslim nations and continue to place curses on the nations that do not follow God as their maker and redeemer?  Rather than blame global warming due to human activity and blaming other nations for the pandemics that are ongoing, maybe we should consider the behavior of the non believers in God and those who are not showing their love of God for the curses that God indicated early on he would place on the humans if they did not follow the Law the relationship God wanted with his people.', 'Omg !!

Yes!  Because the sample size of 1000 is very large.

If we wanted to have a much greater degree of confidence in our predictions, we would have to wait say another 100 years (arguably longer) and then look back over the previous 100 to refine our predictions. \n\nThis, I believe, is a MAJOR UNDERLYING WEAKNESS OF CLIMATE FORECASTING.

Also, fracking is going on around Yellowstone, with resulting frequent earthquakes. A large eruption of Yellowstone can’t be ruled out within our lifetimes.

As he explains, in the warmer Atlantic of the future, more persistent wind shear will likely “weed out some storms, but not all.” And the models indicate that the storms that do materialize and grow will probably be more intense. Knutson’s latest modeling study projects that the number of category-4 and category-5 hurricanes in the Atlantic will double by the end of this century, making a catastrophic storm like Katrina considerably more likely.\n\nKnutson notes several other worrisome trends for the hurricanes of the future as well. He warns that today’s climate models uniformly project that the hotter atmosphere brought about by global warming will retain more moisture. For developing hurricanes, this means more intense precipitation—some 20 percent higher rainfall rates, according to Knutson’s calculations. In addition, he says, current estimates of rising sea levels over the coming century mean that the storm surges caused by intense hurricanes are likely to be more devastating than ever before.""\n\nWill Global Warming Lead to Stronger Hurricanes?\nhttp://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/climate-scientist-thomas-knutson.html#.WgP9a8anGUl\n\nThe Dependence of Hurricane Intensity on Climate\nftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/nature87.pdf\n\nIs This the Worst Hurricane Season Ever?

By the year 2000 there will be about 25 percent more CO2 in our atmosphere than present.”\nCatastrophically, on the 50th anniversary of the White House report, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are indeed at 399 ppm: 25 percent over 1965 levels, exactly as predicted 50 years ago.' \n'Science.http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/259342-fifty-years-ago-the-white-house-knew-all-about-climate"", 'In addition to the Industrial Revolution\'s obvious increase of carbon in the atmosphere causing the ""screeching halt"" of the next ice age, it should be noted that humans have already been exerting their impact on the climate in a gentler, even beneficial way.  The Milankovich cycles suggest that there should have been an 8000 year decline, were it not for the human introduction of agriculture.  William Ruddiman, paleoclimatologist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Virginia suggests that the unprecedented leveling of our CO2 levels and climate have been the result of humans gradually removing carbon sinks from the planet -- our forests, in the name of agriculture.  Since most mass extinction of species happen when there are drastic changes in climate, we have unwittingly been performing a service to biodiversity by being controllers of a biological thermostat.  Of course, that was less than one billion people, and there arises biodiversity issues with loss of forest habitats. Although the Industrial Revolution added 0.6 degrees to the world climate, Ruddiman points out that agriculture has gradually created a differential of 0.8 degrees from where the Milankovich cycles suggested we\'d be!  That means two things -- first, we can stop beating ourselves up over being apart from nature -- nature (with God at the helm, if you will) has enlisted us as keepers of the biothermostat!  Second, we have an incredibly powerful tool in modulating both agriculture and deforestation/reforestation, and mitigating fossil fuels isn\'t the only tool in humanity\'s global cooling kit.  Our choice of food is the key factor in this modulation -- with the crisis created by industrialization (primarily by the energy sector but also by agriculture).  If agriculture could be responsible for adding 0.8 degrees to cancel the ice age, we can also cancel a significant portion of the climate crisis by eliminating animals from our diet.  How fast can we do it?  It\'s something that I\'ve already done and it\'s something that you can do today.  The fight to keep oil in the ground must continue -- in fact, we may need to have some fossil fuels left in our thermostat tool kit several hundred years from now when the Milankovich cycles start to push that ice age even harder.  Whenever anyone talks about geoengineering most methods are treacherous and uncertain.  Technology has given us the means to measure our planet\'s fever (hear that Mr. Trump?  We still need NASA) and use an all-natural remedy -- reforestation and elimination of food animals.  http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v292/n3/box/scientificamerican0305-46_BX4.html', 'Education about the subject of global warming/climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our day.

Where adults could enjoy the hard-earned fruits of their labor, be it physical or mental. That also means the right to move about whenever one chooses, not to be constrained to a bus/train schedule. It lent to the creation of shopping centers, where accessibility to many goods and services were possible. Later on, home delivery/serviceability made living even easier. The 'nuclear family' jargon was identified with suburban living, where families could be able to make their own way, without the prying eyes and ears of others. \n\nIt's not surprising that some have a disdain for such living, usually those that are younger, more socially inclined. It is when one gets older, better employed and more settled that wants to occupy something with more room for a family to grow besides a town home or a semi-detatched house. Even if that person or couple were to be employed in a major or secondary city, personal transportation will still serve these people.

I think that would get a lot more people on board. 2. Not to nitpick but i strongly disagree when you lump Bose noise-cancelling headphones in with trivial things like fast fashion. I suffer from tinnitus and Bose noise-cancelling headphones have made a real difference in my life by reducing the noises that trigger my debilitating condition. There are thousands of tinnitus sufferers who have had similar experiences. I did not buy my Bose because of advertising or to keep up with the Jones’s. I bought them to alleviate a terrible medical condition and this they do really well.']"

They broke barriers and changed perceptions in the process. What’s more, your myopic analysis of the story completely omits the more spiritual and emotional tenor of the film that centres on maintaining relationships in the face of loss and grief, seeking peace through achievement, and testing one’s capabilities, not in response to some negative drive, but because they strive to test themselves in the harshest and most technically demanding locations on the planet. All athletes seek to test themselves at the height of what is possible.

They meet death every expedition, their ego’s are well in check in the face of this constant threat, they manage loss and grief openly, emotionally, and they are more spiritually in tune with nature as a result and show great respect for the places they visit.

After that all the inferred electromagnetic radiation from the surface that can loosely interact  with the lumpy electrostatic fields of greenhouse gas molecules is considered completely absorbed and its further heat transfer is by convection i.e. molecules bumping into each other.

In fact, biologically, the Arctic is in good shape with all its regions showing a positive trend in primary productivity over an extended period (2003-2022).

This shows that the decline in extent is a clear trend, and that much of the Arctic Ocean is indeed functionally ice free for a significant part of the late summer. \n\nWhat is interesting is the Arctic sea ice extent goes up and down every year and that the Arctic Sea/Arctic Ocean consists of 8 seas, a straight, and a bay with its lowest coverage in September so it makes sense that measurements done in the 30s and 40s are pretty much is irrelevant especially when they were not done in all the regions.

The next Great Winter (Milankovitch Minima) is weak, so that is uncertain.\nWhat we DO know is that CO2 has NO effect on ice ages.  When CO2 levels are high, the world cools i to an ice age.  When CO2 levels are low, the world warms into an interglacial.  The climate would not do that, if CO2 was the primary feedback system.  In truth, the primary feedback is ice albedo and dust.\n\nSo the primary thing that will prevent a new ice age is Chinese industrial dust on the northern ice sheets.  \n\nAnd why is anyone afraid of high CO2 and warmth?  Dinosaurs thrived in that environment.  CO2 is plant food, and the most important gas in the atmosphere.  It is the increased plant growth, due to high CO2, that underpinned the large size of dinosaurs.

Do it, make it into a game, with the whole data set that lets the player see life is effected by time, and the impacts of man. Let them work out ways in the game to lessen the impacts of man, such as reducing power, electric cars, recycling, land management. So many ways this data set could be used. It could be used in schools, in government, and should be available for all to explore and find the beauty of all life, and not just the sexy animals. With the right approach, you could even change climate change disbelievers into believers, especially if you included data on ice loss, and glacier speeds. Do it, the only way we can slow climate change is to get people to change their behaviour, and to do that, they need to want to do it. A game like this could create that want. Do it! If you don't do it, then you're not really serious about changing peoples attitudes to climate change. You have to do this. Either work with a game developer, make it cheap so it's open to the widest amount of people. It's not about money, it's about education. Do it please.""]"

That is that since 1980 when we started to pump out 20gt of CO2 per year correlates with the hypothesis that CO2 emission cause a minor decadal warming. It also concurs with the lag effect time line of Circa 20 years when the effects become pronounced. I don't think that's the end of the story but just the beginning. CO2 emission are cumulative....... Within these graphs and observed temperature records it also seems to show that........... for a doubling of CO2 emissions there is a quadrupling of the effect? Is this due to increased release from permafrost CO2 and CH4 due to warming effects....... Or does doubling of emissions force warming at an accelerated pace? Either way, by current data we can see the decadal temperature increase has quadrupled...... Continuation of this trend will see a decadal increase of 1'c per decade for 2020-30 shooting us to the 2'c threshold by 2030........ 2040 and we will be beyond 3'c.....

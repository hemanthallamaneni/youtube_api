5,Xp5p5ATmKi4,ClimateScience - Solve Climate Change,Floating Communities??? #Shorts,"Floating cities may sound like fantasy, but some designers are actually beginning to create structures that embrace rising sea levels. Global sea level rise is expected to exceed two meters by the end of the century if no serious climate action is taken [8]. This has the potential to displace approximately 200 million people [8]. With increasing sea level rise, adaptation solutions to combat it have become essential [7] one of them being floating structures! 

Floating architecture may serve as a solution due to its relatively low economic and logistical maintainability. These afloat settlements could provide safe, climate-resilient housing for flood-stricken communities. Do you think floating architecture could be the game changer in combating sea level rise? Let us know in the comments!

7,36hohyrQrP8,ClimateScience - Solve Climate Change,Undo Climate Change? #Shorts,"1 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide. That’s the amount we’d need to remove if we want to undo climate change. That's roughly the same weight as one blue whale for every person on Earth! [3,11]

Think of carbon removal as a pollution cleanup operation. For it to work, CO₂ must be captured from the atmosphere and stored away safely and permanently without emitting more along the way [1]. 

There are lots of ways to do this: soil carbon sequestration; direct air capture; geological carbon storage; enhanced weathering and more [4,5,6,7].

But it’s really important to remember: we can’t let dreams of carbon sequestration delay emissions reduction today. 

Were there any carbon removal methods you were curious about and would like us to cover more deeply? Let us know in the comments! Bye!

48,jYjvJyEMHZ4,Science ABC,What are GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms)?,"GMO or genetically modified organisms are organisms with their DNA modified, usually by adding new or different DNA from another organism. GM crops are crops that have genes from bacteria. These genes allow the plants to either produce chemicals that can kill only insect pests, or be resistant to herbicide. Since the plants have DNA from another species, they are called transgenic crops. We grow GM crops on nearly 185 million hectares in 26 countries, including 19 developing countries. That’s roughly 12% of the global cropland. We regularly produce GM soybean, corn, cotton, alfalfa, canola, apples, papaya, potatoes, summer squash, sugar beets, and pineapple. So, what is the science behind these crops? How do we make such crops in the lab?

49,H-FyOpURPXI,Science ABC,Photoelectric Effect Explained in Simple Words for Beginners,"Photoelectric effect occurs when electromagnetic radiation above the threshold frequency of the given metallic surface, strikes the surface and releases electrons from it. This happens because light is made of massless particles called photons, which possess a certain amount of energy. When these photons strike the surface, they knock electrons off it; we call these photoelectron. 

Just because a light ray has a high intensity doesn't mean that it will cause the photoelectric effect. It can only happen if the frequency of the light rays is equal to or greater than a given value—known as the threshold frequency—of the metal. In this video, we have explained the photoelectric effect, threshold frequency and the work function in simple words

51,KJU4vZMHegg,Science ABC,Bose Einstein Condensate Explained in Simple Words,"Bose Einstein condensate is considered the fifth state of matter - it’s obtained when gas particles are cooled to almost absolute zero temperature. To generate the Bose-Einstein condensate, the first step is to obtain a cloud of gas; a typical example is the gas of rubidium atoms. The next step is to use lasers to remove the atoms' energy and cool them down. An evaporative cooling method is utilized for further cooling until the atoms are close to absolute zero. At this stage, the atoms assume the same quantum states and operate as a single entity. If you were to measure their location at this point, you would observe a blurred ball, rather than individual atoms.

Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) have various practical uses in precision measurement and sensing technologies, which have led to advancements in detecting gravitational waves, creating navigation systems, and improving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, BECs have been used to develop atom lasers, which hold great potential for the precise manipulation of atomic matter. This advancement has already aided research in quantum optics and lithography.

53,BBwULYIOkfk,Science ABC,What is Blackbody Radiation: Explained in Simple Terms,"A black body is a theoretical or imaginary object that perfectly absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation, and also emits radiation, like heat and visible light, based on its temperature. A black body is considered theoretical because no object can be a perfect absorber of electromagnetic radiation. Think of it this way: when you heat an iron rod, it becomes extremely hot, and its color changes to dull red, followed by bright red, orange and then yellow. This is a good example of how black body radiation works. 

In this video, you will learn about blackbody radiation, the blackbody radiation curve and how it helps to understand electromagnetic radiation and celestial bodies.

While bullets travel incredibly fast and pack a concentrated force, the size and momentum of the bullet are too small to knock a person off their feet. Factors such as bullet weight and location on the body also play a role in the impact felt by the victim. However, the shooter is more likely to experience the backward force of recoil, which can be strong enough to knock them off their feet.

79,cW4kG9a5xA4,Science ABC,Singularity and Event Horizon: The Mysterious World of Black Holes,"Have you ever heard of a black hole? In the 1960s, the renowned physicists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose predicted that a star with an even denser mass would collapse into a point of infinite density, creating a singularity. At this point, the known laws of physics break down, and spacetime curvature becomes so severe that any light that falls into the pit is held captive forever. This is how a black hole is formed.

In this Youtube short, we will explore the fascinating world of black holes, from singularity to the event horizon. You’ll discover how the singularity of a black hole distorts the spacetime around it, and how the event horizon marks the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole’s gravitational pull.

Join us on a journey to the heart of darkness as we explore the mysteries of black holes and the enigma of singularity and event horizon. This 32-second video will leave you in awe of these cosmic phenomena' infinite density and power. #blackhole #singularity #eventhorizon","['black hole', 'singularity', 'event horizon', 'Stephen Hawking', 'Roger Penrose', 'physics', 'spacetime curvature', 'infinite density', 'gravitational pull', 'cosmic phenomena', 'universe', 'exploration', 'mystery', 'enigma', 'journey', 'infinite power']",2023-04-26 07:36:25+00:00,4518,226,,5,PT32S,hd,true,Wednesday,0 days 00:00:32,16,50.02213368747233,1.1066843736166445,66
80,egOxIjb4QhI,Science ABC,Boltzmann Brain Paradox Explained in Simple Words,"A Boltzmann brain is not real, but what’s fascinating about it is that it thinks it’s real, and all the memories and experiences it has are real. But, of course, this brain is not real. But how would such a brain know that its memories are artificial and its existence is more like a hallucination? How would we know that we aren’t those artificial brains? This is the Boltzmann Brain paradox, the result of Ludwig Boltzmann’s many years of debate with other scientists on his interpretation of entropy.

In this video, we discuss the Boltzmann brain in simple terms and understand why we humans are real and not Boltzmann brains!

85,jKYBZF5P1PM,Science ABC,What Have Sunflowers Got To Do With Nuclear Disasters?,"Sunflowers are the international symbol for nuclear disarmament. You will most likely find sunflowers around areas where nuclear disasters have occurred in the past. Following the 1986 meltdown at the Chernobyl Power Plant in Ukraine, which released over 100 radioactive elements into the environment, sunflowers were planted in droves to extract the radioactive isotopes from the fallout-impacted sites. This approach is based on the principle of phytoremediation, which employs the use of plants to cleanse the environment.

The Chernobyl sunflower project was born in 1994 when a New Jersey-based company planted sunflowers on a floating raft with the intention to absorb radioactive isotopes from the water. It was observed that the plants selectively absorbed radio-cesium (137Cs) and radio-strontium (90Sr) from the water, and results indicated that about 95% of the radio-nuclides had been cleared out in a span of only ten days. In this video, we explore this magical ability of sunflowers in more detail.

87,G9t__9Tmwv4,Science ABC,Climate Change and Global Warming: Explained in Simple Words for Beginners,"The term climate change is used to denote the long-term changes in the weather patterns in a given region. Another term often interchanged with climate change is global warming. Global warming is formally defined as a rise in Earth's temperature that persists for a decade or longer.
There could be several causes for climate change, but the biggest one is the rising concentration of greenhouse gases. Simply put, greenhouse gases are those gases in our atmosphere that trap heat. Some examples include carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and ozone.

Natural sources and human activities both result in the emission of greenhouse gases. One of the most common ways these gases get released into the atmosphere is through the burning of fossil fuels. Burning coal or oil to run industrial processes or giant factories increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Indeed, fossil fuels' contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is the largest, in the range of 70- 80% of total emissions.

In this video, we explain, in simple terms, climate change and global warming and what we can do as a community and individually to save Earth from climate change.

88,Tn3c6wgNjB8,Science ABC,Endocrine System: How Hormones Work?,"The endocrine system is composed of glands that produce hormones to affect changes in distant target organs. It is crucial in maintaining homeostasis—balance—in the body. There are seven major endocrine glands scattered throughout the body: the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, the thyroid, the thymus, the pancreas, the adrenal glands and the gonads (testes or ovaries) (eight if you count the hypothalamus). All endocrine glands secrete their hormones into the bloodstream from there the hormones travel to the target organs.

89,FVUbIaD94Ao,Science ABC,Neutron Stars Explained in Simple Words for Laymen,"Neutron stars are formed from the core of some starrs. Neutron stars generally have a radius of only around 12 km. With masses exceeding 1.4 times that of the Sun, these are some of the densest objects in the Universe. A tablespoonful of neutron star material could weigh as much as Mount Everest. 
They are called neutron stars because they are composed almost entirely of neutrons. There are also trace amounts of an equal number of electrons and protons, given the whole object a net neutral charge.
Neutron stars also create one of the most powerful magnetic fields in the universe. Their magnetic fields can be as much as one million billion (or one quadrillion), times stronger than that of Earth. In fact, in 2004, a neutron star, located around 50,000 light-years away, underwent an outburst. Its magnetic field was so strong that it affected the Earth's ionosphere, even from that monumental distance!
We have discovered more than 2,500 neutron stars so far. Some well-known examples include the Crab Pulsar, located in the Crab Nebula, and the Vela Pulsar, found in the Vela Supernova Remnant.

90,ghbZytkg7rY,Science ABC,How Robert J. Oppenheimer became the ‘Father of the Atomic Bomb’,"Robert J. Oppenheimer, born on April 22, 1904, is known as the father of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer was awarded a PhD in theoretical physics and was interested in the emerging field of quantum physics. As a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, Oppenheimer was involved in the latest research in nuclear and quantum physics. In 1942, Oppenheimer became the Director of The Manhattan project, a project to develop a nuclear weapon that could be used against the Axis powers during work. His ambition, genius, and energy allowed him to lead one of the most ambitious projects modern physics had ever seen. 
After the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer saw the devastation that nuclear weapons could cause. A large part of his later years were spent trying to ensure that nuclear weapons would not be misused by any government of the world. Unfortunately, the Cold war era and fear of communism would turn the father of the nuclear bomb into a target for suspicion. 

Fun fact: Oppenheimer was often called Oppie by his students and fellow colleagues.

91,BiR1cPisge8,Science ABC,Higgs Boson (The God Particle) and Higgs Field Explained in Simple Words,"The Higgs boson is a wave, ripple or disturbance in an invisible, all-permeating field called the Higgs field. In the year 1964, Peter Higgs, François Englert and four other scientists proposed a rather unique idea to explain why certain particles had mass. They hypothesized that the entire universe is filled with an invisible, all-permeating field that gives mass to all elementary particles.

The field in question is called the Higgs field. A wave, ripple or disturbance in that field is therefore called the Higgs boson, or the Higgs particle.

This theory suggests that particles do not have a mass of their own; rather, they get their mass by interacting with the Higgs field. How heavy a particle is will be determined by how strongly a particle interacts with the Higgs field. Electrons, quarks and other elementary particles interact with the Higgs field in different ways and therefore have different masses. Photons, however, don’t interact with the field, and thus have no mass.

92,hxETN4EKJvA,Science ABC,Slowing or Reversing Aging: Can We Live for 180 years?,"Ageing is a complex process which results from progressive loss of the body’s ability to maintain itself. This ageing comes with diseases and a general decline in health. Over the past few decades, scientists have come to better understand how we age and are now imagining a future where you could live up to 100 and be fit as a fiddle. 

Although, reaching the unbelievable age of 180 might not be possible… yet. A healthy 100 is far from uncommon, and perhaps we will push that to 130 years of healthy living, but we'll only find out when we, and our research, age a bit further.

93,W1Z2y38lvbU,Science ABC,Detectives Use this Simple Technique to Find Your Fingerprints (Even AFTER You Have Wiped Them Off)!,"There’s a common movie trope of an actor wiping their fingerprints off a gun. It seems like a simple wipe with a cloth eliminates any trace of a criminal’s guilt, but that isn’t actually the case!
Scientists have developed a method that can visualize prints from even the faintest fingerprint deposits left after the metal of a gun is wiped off. This technique uses a colored-electro active film that uses fingerprint residues as a stencil for blocking the electric current. Once a voltage is passed through, the oily regions deflect the colored substances surrounding bare regions, which gives rise to a negative ridge pattern.

As it turns out 360 is actually a very good number. From a purely mathematical standpoint, a number like 10 or 100 would have been more inconvenient.

You see, the number 360 is divisible by every number from 1 to 10, aside from 7. In addition to that, 360 has 24 divisors. This is the highest number of divisors for any positive whole number up to its own value of 360. This is just one of the reasons why a circle is 360 degrees. 

In this video, we have discussed some other reasons that make 360 an idea number for calculations.

These constitute everything that we are made of, both matter and energy. But how is it any different from regular physics? The 'regular' physics is the physics that deals with Newton’s laws of motion and its related mechanics. This is more formally called Classical Physics.

This is the physics of our day-to-day lives—the rolling of balls, the rotation of the earth, and the mechanics of engines. Quantum physics deals with particles that are incredibly small and hence, the laws of classical physics don’t apply in this world. In this video, we discuss the meaning of quantum physics and how is it going to change how we perceive the world around us.

97,cOuvxEK1Smg,Science ABC,Gasoline (Petrol) vs Diesel: Which one is better? A Beginner’s Guide,"Gasoline (petrol) and diesel are extracted from the same raw material – crude oil—and pass through various levels of refinement. Yet, they have different thermal characteristics, making them suitable for very different purposes. For example, diesel has a higher density than gasoline, which makes it more energy-intensive. Due to this, less diesel is required to produce the same energy output as gasoline. Similarly,  diesel engines are bulky, and typically consist of longer piston strokes, so they can’t reach high RPMs without incurring a lot of mechanical strain. This causes a loss in the total power output, although diesel's benefit from the tremendous torque that is generally lacking in gasoline engines.

In this video, we compare a number of features of diesel and gasoline engines to look at which fuel is better, or in other words, is there really a better fuel?

98,Kkwp7Ap6N9A,Science ABC,Black Holes Explained: What Is a Black Hole? How They Form in Space?,"A black hole is a celestial body or simply a place in space where the gravitational pull is so high that nothing, not even light can escape it. This is why it's completely black, and hence it's called a black hole. A black hole's “surface,” called its event horizon, defines the boundary where the velocity needed to escape exceeds the speed of light.

When a massive star dies, it leaves a small but dense remnant core in its wake. If the mass of the core if more than around 3 times the mass of the sun, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and a black hole is formed.

A black hole is not just empty space; in fact, it’s a great deal of amount packed into a very small area. Think of a star which is 10 times more massive than our is squeezed into a sphere which has the diameter equal to the size of New York city. The result will be a celestial object whose gravitational field is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. This is why black holes are named so, because they are pitch black!


""Black holes explained"" is a short-animated video explaining the science of ‘what is a black hole’ and ‘how black holes are formed’? The ""black hole picture 2019"" is a recent event that occurred in April 2019, which involved the release of the first ever black hole picture to the general public. But what are black holes? How are black holes formed? What’s the explanation behind the black hole theory?

99,JaXMGFShqDE,Science ABC,Gut Microbiome Explained in Simple Words,"The gut microbiome are the trillions of microorganisms – primarily bacteria, but also fungi, viruses and protists – that live inside your digestive system. Scientists are discovering that these microbes are vital for us to live healthy lives. They help us digest food and provide us with nutrients, they can modulate our mood and help us sleep better, and they even help the immune system do their job better. 

Gut bacteria are those bacteria that live inside the digestive system of all animals, including humans. We’ve found that these bacteria are crucial to our health, both physical and mental. They help us digest food, provide us with nutrients and help us fend of pathogenic bacteria.

Simply put – gut bacteria, also known as the gut microbiota, are the bacteria present in our bodies lined across the inner walls of our gastrointestinal tract. There are about 300-500 bacterial species in the human gut with their average population being 100 trillion. That’s enough to fill twelve thousand, six hundred and fifty-eight Earths at our current population. Initially, that was thought to be ten times the number of human cells in our body but new research suggests the ratio of bacterial cells to human cells could be 1.3:1.

100,vIeRLeQq7V4,Science ABC,"Particle accelerators: What are they, how do they work and why are they important to us?","A particle accelerator is a machine that accelerates particles. More specifically, it accelerates elementary particles, like protons and electrons, at extremely high speeds—almost 99.99% of the speed of light. These particles are then smashed against a stationary target or against other particles traveling in the opposite direction. These collisions produce massive particles, such as the top quark or the Higgs boson, which last for only a fraction of a second. Then, almost immediately, these particles convert into smaller, lighter particles, which, in turn, decay almost instantly. These collisions not only help us understand the composition of the elementary particles in question but also supplement our knowledge of our universe’s origin immediately following the Big Bang.

Particle accelerators can be broadly classified into two categories—linear accelerators (also called LINACs) and circular accelerators. In this video, we discuss linear and circular accelerators and their respective applications.

The series followed the tragedy that befell the region after the accident and the efforts made by some heroic people to prevent further damage. 

In this video, we will discuss the scientific accuracy of some key aspects of this widely popular show. We also discuss how the RBMK reactor works and is it really possible for an RBMK reactor to explode?

104,TLGcmDbleWQ,Science ABC,Multiverse Theory Explained: Does the Multiverse Really Exist? Truth of Multiple Realities,"Multiverse theory suggests that our universe, which consists of billions and billions of planets, stars and galaxies and extends out tens of billions of light-years, may not be the only universe that exists. There could be another universe that is completely different from ours with its own natural laws. Even more maddeningly, there may not be just one, but an infinite number of such universes, all of which differ from one another and harbor millions of celestial bodies and even intelligent life forms, just as our universe does.

Multiverse theory assumes that our universe is only a small member of an enormous composition of a multitude of universes.

The idea of multiple universes is so astounding that it has been hypothesized not only in cosmology and astronomy, but also in philosophy, music, literature, science fiction, and even religion. Because of the universality of this idea, these “other"" universes are called by different names, including parallel universes, alternative universes, parallel realities, quantum realities, alternative realities, and more.
In this video, we explain what exactly is the multiverse theory and what it means for humankind.

105,3khY_bwf5FY,Science ABC,What Exactly is Spacetime? Explained in Ridiculously Simple Words,"Spacetime, as a concept, is related to a space that consists of 4 dimensions instead of the regular 3-dimensional space. As early as 1905, Einstein proposed a now widely popular theory that the speed of light is independent of the motion of all observers, and that space and time are interconnected in a single continuum. This theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern and quantum physics, is known as Einstein’s special theory of relativity. Einstein's proposed idea of a single continuum where space and time are interwoven is what people call “space-time”.
According to this theory, time—which has traditionally been considered an independent entity according to the principles of classical physics—is affected when a body moves through space. This happens because, according to the theory, time and space are connected and part of a single continuum—spacetime.
In this video, we discuss spacetime in absolutely simple words: what exactly is spacetime and how is it related to the force of gravitation and Einstein’s theory of relativity?

106,v48u8hjqNBU,Science ABC,"What Are The Different Atomic Models? Dalton, Rutherford, Bohr and Heisenberg Models Explained","Atomic Models: Centuries ago, people didn’t know exactly what was inside an atom, but they had some “ideas”. Around 400 BC, a Greek philosopher named Democritus came up with a theory that everything in the world was made of tiny indestructible particles called “atomos”, which means “uncuttable”. However, this theory was largely discredited by Aristotle—the original social influencer, who believed that everything on this planet was made of four elements: earth, fire, water, and air. 
The next step in atomic theory development didn’t happen for nearly 2000 years, when British chemist John Dalton conducted some experiments. Following his breakthrough, Dalton proposed that everything in the world was made up of atoms—tiny indestructible solid spheres that were unique for every element. Atoms of different elements combine to form different compounds and are rearranged during chemical reactions. 
After that, came an English physicist named J.J Thompson and his trusty cathode ray tube. He proposed the famous “plum pudding” model. This model characterizes an atom as a particle that is composed of a positively charged mass (the pudding), as well as tiny negative charges embedded in it (like plums). After this, another chemist called Rutherford proposed his model of an atom where most of the atom’s mass was concentrated in a positively charged center (which he later named the nucleus) around which the electrons orbited like planets around the sun. After Rutherford, another chemist Neils Bohr theorized that if an electron jumped to a lower energy orbit, it would give out the extra energy in the form of radiation, thereby maintaining atomic stability. Even though Bohr’s model doesn’t hold true for complex multi-electron systems, this model is still the most popular representation of atomic structure in most textbooks.

108,yYUImmcq-bc,Science ABC,Emotions and the Brain: What is the limbic system?,"The limbic system is the term for various parts of the brain involved in emotions such as fear, aggression, and attraction, and behaviors related to these emotions, as well as memory, learning, and senses. The four important parts of the limbic system are the amygdala, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus. 

The olfactory system and the thalamus.
For most senses such as touch and sight, sensory neurons make their first stop at the thalamus and then make their way to other parts of the brain. But, for the sense of smell, the olfactory neurons from the nose make their first stop at the olfactory bulb in the brain. There is some evidence (sources included in the references) that from the olfactory cortex, neurons make their way to the thalamus (the mediothamalic nuclei) for higher sensory processing.

109,8-t-1EkOhAE,Science ABC,Dark Matter Explained: What Exactly is Dark Matter? | A Beginner’s Guide to Dark Matter,"Dark matter is an invisible matter that occupies more than half of the space of the observable universe but cannot be detected directly as it doesn’t interact with electromagnetic radiation, like visible light and gamma rays. One of the greatest challenges that astral scientists and researchers face before they can fully understand the universe is so-called ""dark matter."" Originally called the ‘missing matter’, dark matter is the name given to particles that don’t absorb or emit light, making them impossible to detect through observing electromagnetic radiation.

Think of it this way—how do you see or observe something in your everyday life?
You are able to see things because visible light, a type of electromagnetic radiation, bounces off objects around you and then reaches your eyes. All celestial bodies interact with electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, radio waves, gamma rays, and the rest. More notably, they alter the way radiation travels around them, which is how we detect far-off galaxies hiding billions upon billions of miles away.
But dark matter cannot be observed this way, because it doesn’t interact with electromagnetic radiation. Check out this video to learn more about dark matter, how was it first discovered and how is it detected now.

110,KjIUzV094wE,Science ABC,What Exactly is a Tesseract? (Hint: Not a Superhero Stone),"A tesseract is a 4D cube, i.e. a cube that exists in 4 dimensions. Although fans of the Marvel universe and superheroes may associate tesseract with the glowing blue box that houses the Space stone, a tesseract is a real geometrical concept that exists in four dimensions. 

Here is a simple way to conceptualize dimensions: a square is a 2D shape, so each of its corners has 2 lines coming off it at 90 degrees to each other. A cube is three-dimensional, so each of its corners has 3 lines coming off it. Similarly, a tesseract is a 4D shape, so every corner has 4 lines coming off it.
Mathematically speaking, a tesseract is a perfectly accurate and plausible shape, as are all shapes in higher dimensions, such as 5D and 6D. Just as a cube can be unfolded into 6 squares in 2D space, a tesseract can be unfolded into 8 cubes in 3D space.

112,2tv6Ej6JVho,Science ABC,What is the Fibonacci Sequence & the Golden Ratio? Simple Explanation and Examples in Everyday Life,"The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which a given number is the addition of the two numbers before it. So, if you start with 0, the next number will be 1, followed by 1, followed by 2, followed by 3 and so on. As you can see, every number in this series or sequence is obtained by adding the two preceding numbers. This simple series of numbers is referred to as the Fibonacci sequence for Fibonacci series. And individual numbers in this sequence are often called Fibonacci numbers.

To the uninitiated, it may just seem like a series of numbers, but the Fibonacci sequence has been discovered and rediscovered in various forms, not only in mathematics, but also in nature and our everyday lives. 

There’s another exciting offshoot of the Fibonacci sequence - the golden ratio. Seashells are one of the most common examples of the golden spiral in nature. Ocean waves, hurricanes, flower buds, snail shells, spider webs are some of the many naturally-occurring examples.

The digestive system is composed of the long continuous alimentary tract or gastrointestinal tract (or simply gut) and accessory organs like the pancreas, liver, gallbladder. Our digestive system also receives help from gut bacteria that reside in the intestines.
But that's just the surface of the digestive system. New research shows that our guts affect our body in surprising ways. Our gut communicates with the nervous system and might affect our moods and mental health. The gut bacteria help the immune system fight of deadly pathogens! Our digestive tract is more complex than first appears.

114,M0uw4ZNpqcI,Science ABC,What is Radioactivity and Is It Always Harmful: Explained in Really Simple Words,"Radioactivity is the property through which a heavier, unstable nucleus assumes a more stable state by emitting radiation. The process through which a nucleus turns into a stable one is called radioactive decay. But is radioactivity or radioactive radiation always harmful? Let’s discuss this in more detail.
Inside an atom’s nucleus, there are positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. These nucleons are held together by a “glue” called the strong nuclear force. This strong force cancels out the repulsive electrostatic force of like charged protons and keeps the nucleus stable. The nuclear force has a short range of action and is dependent on the ratio of neutrons and protons present in a nucleus. However, we see that the balance between the forces starts to waver in a nucleus where the number of neutrons exceeds the number of protons. A nucleus that exceeds the threshold number of neutrons and protons that the strong nuclear force can hold together comfortably will be more unstable.
More specifically, these scenarios give rise to unstable isotopes of elements. Just as your body, through a series of expansions and contractions, expels a substance with a sneeze, similarly, the unstable isotopes of elements fling out different particles or forms of energy to restore balance between the forces in their nucleus. During this process of attaining stability, they change into a new nucleus. It is exactly this property, namely turning into something new to attain stability, that we call radioactivity.

The rungs of the ladder are made of four different chemicals that pair with each other - A with T, C with G. The sequence of these chemicals is how the information is stored in DNA. Certain proteins read this ""code"" (ATCGCG) to create proteins. These proteins go on to form cells, cells form tissues which go on to form organs and all the organs come together to form a living being.

116,MKbF-MvRjEU,Science ABC,Grandfather Paradox: Explained in Simple Words,"The grandfather paradox is considered the biggest, most popular objection to the logical possibility of backwards time travel. It characterizes a hypothetical situation in which a time traveller goes to their past and ends up causing an event (like, the killing of their grandfather) which makes travelling to the past and altering it impossible.
What this means is that if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, you don’t exist, which means that your grandfather cannot be killed. As you can see, there are two realities occurring in parallel here. The grandfather paradox is also a key plot element in the famous Hollywood movie Tenet (released in 2020), directed by Christopher Nolan.
Although all this talk about time travel and the grandfather paradox is obviously purely hypothetical, there is evidence of two realities occurring in parallel at the same time. This is a phenomenon in the quantum world which is known as superposition.

118,2KMAv880v6s,Science ABC,Gravitational Lensing: What It Is And How It Is Helping Us Discover New Galaxies,"Gravitational lensing occurs when a huge amount of matter, like a star, galaxy, or cluster of galaxies, creates a powerful gravitational field around it, strong enough to bend the light coming from distant galaxies (behind them). Roots of gravitational lensing lie in Einstein theory of relativity which states that massive bodies warp the space around it. Thereby the light passing through this warped space curves near massive celestial bodies. Depending upon the position of emitting, lensing and observing body, gravitational lensing may distort, magnify or lead to multiple occurrences of the same object in different places. 

Leveraging the concept of gravitational lensing, a technique called microlensing is developed which is helping us in discovering new galaxies and dark matter. Einstein ring is a beautiful phenomena observed using microlensing which we have illustrated in this video using animations. Thus, Einstein's ground-breaking work on general relativity in 1915 has paved the way for astronomers to continue studying the very structure of the Universe leveraging the power of gravity!

119,wChr0hCga5g,Science ABC,Archimedes Principle: Explained in Really Simple Words,"Archimedes principle states that if an object is submerged in a fluid, then the buoyant force acting on it is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by that object. Buoyant force exists because pressure increases as an object goes deeper in a fluid, which, in this case, is water. Due to this, the force from the pressure exerted in the downward direction on the top of the object is LESS than the force from pressure exerted in the upward direction on the bottom of the object. 
When Archmiedes got into the bathtub, he realized that as more of his body was submerged in water, the more water spilled over the bathtub’s edge. He realized that there must be a clear relationship between his weight and the weight of the water displaced by his submerged body. This was a groundbreaking idea, and one that could be applied to solve the problem of determining the purity of gold in Hieron’s crown.

This change in organisms or populations happens through DNA mutations and reconbination and is passed down to the next generation through reproduction. 
In this video we tackle what is evolution and address what people misunderstand about evolution and how it happens. So, here’s a compressed crash course on evolution - from the mutations and recombinations in the DNA which create diversity to environmental factors like natural selection and genetic drift.

121,m7gXgHgQGhw,Science ABC,What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Explained in Simple Words,"Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle says that if we know everything about where a particle is located, we know nothing about its momentum. Conversely, if we know everything about its momentum, then we know nothing about where the particle is located. In other words, this principle means that we cannot measure the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision or certainty. 
But waves, as you know, don’t exist in one specific place. However, you can certainly identify and measure specific characteristics of a wave pattern as a whole, most notably, its wavelength, which is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs. Particles that are as small or even smaller than atoms have large enough wavelengths to be detected, and can therefore be measured in experiments. 
Thus, if we have a wave whose wavelength and momentum can be measured accurately, then it’s impossible to measure its specific position. Conversely, if we know the position of a particle with high certainty, then we cannot accurately determine its momentum. This is what Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is all about.

122,Rq9Wd3RiNrc,Science ABC,Why Are Planetary Orbits Elliptical?,"Planetary orbits are elliptical because gravitational interaction over time changes the delicate balance of mass, velocity and distance from the star which otherwise keeps planetary orbit circular.
For a very long time, from Ptolemy to the age of Copernicus, it was widely believed and accepted that planets in our Solar System revolved in a perfectly circular path. Because the circle was presumed to be an ideal shape for planetary bodies to orbit. But then in the seventeenth century in his seminal book Astronomia Nova, Johannes Kepler rebutted this very idea. He put forth his own theory pertaining to planetary motion. He theorized that planetary bodies orbit in an elliptical path with the Sun sitting at one of the foci of that ellipse. In this video we will try to understand what makes these planetary orbits elliptical.

123,TlSOMfDX-yY,Science ABC,Why Are There Stones Along Railway Tracks?,"The crushed stones that line railroad tracks are collectively called track ballast. More specifically, the track ballast constitutes the trackbed upon which sleepers or railroad ties are laid. As you may have seen, these stones are packed below, between and around the railroad ties. The thickness of the track ballast usually ranges between 25-30 cm, and varies depending on certain conditions pertaining to the geographical location of the railway track.

Track ballast usually consists of crushed rocks or stone, but in some cases, less suitable alternatives, like burnt clay, are also used. However, it’s important to understand that you can’t just throw a bunch of rocks on a railroad and be done with it. As mentioned, the stones in the track ballast have a characteristic shape, size and texture. Their surface is not smooth and their edges are jagged, and for good reason. These rocks interlock with each other and therefore stay in place. If you replace them with circular or smooth rocks, they would slide over each other and compromise the strength of the track ballast. As you might imagine, this can have catastrophic results.

Anyhow, this dance, anthropologists think, is one glue that holds societies together.

125,fkAAbXPEAtU,Science ABC,Quantum Entanglement: Explained in REALLY SIMPLE Words,"Quantum entanglement is a physical resource, like energy, that is possible between quantum systems. When a coin spins on a flat surface, it’s in a state of superposition between its two faces—head and tails. Similarly, electrons in their natural state exist as a superposition of both up and down spin. Only when measured do they give a definite value of up or down, which, in technical terms, is referred to as the “collapse of the wavefunction”.

In quantum mechanics, wave function collapse occurs when a wave function, which was initially in a superposition of a few states, reduces to a single state due to interaction with the external world.

When a pair of electrons are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity, their spin states can get entangled, which is what scientists call the quantum entanglement of electrons.


Quantum entanglement was first recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Roson and Schrodinger. In this video, we explain quantum entanglement in simple terms so that it becomes accessible to laymen and children who are interested to know about quantum entanglement

Lightning is one of the incredible forces of nature. A single bolt of it carries a few billion joules of energy, sufficient enough to power a tens of homes for a day. Humanity since the time of Franklin and Maxwell has been contemplating the idea of capturing lightning in a bottle but thus far we have got very little success. Volatile nature, sporadic appearance and uneven geographical distribution have made it very difficult to tap this nature's source of energy. Then our electrical systems aren't advanced enough to handle this sudden burst of electricity.  Although projects like Project First Light are ongoing with a mission to harvest energy from lightning, it is still under nascent stage. Perhaps it would take years before we could start using lightning as a renewable source of energy.

But, is that even possible? Science says, not really. When the insect's exoskeleton expands it gets too heavy and it doesn't expand enough for all the muscles of the insect to attach to it. There also isn't enough oxygen for insects to get large; 300 million years ago there was more oxygen and insects were as large as hawks. But, when birds and bats evolved, they began competing with and preying on large insects which led to the small insects we have today.

129,asTtd2nEd_A,Science ABC,Why Don't They Have Parachutes For Passengers In Commercial Planes?,"Commercial airplanes don't give parachutes to passengers. While airplanes have plenty of safety features that help in landing them safely during emergencies, having parachutes onboard for every passenger doesn't seem like a bad idea, does it? Although it may not seem so, but there are several good reasons why they don't hand out parachutes to passengers as they board a commercial airplane.

Firstly, a commercial plane flies way too high. At that altitude, any skydive would be riddled with countless risks. The temperature at that height is many degrees below the freezing point. Furthermore, the oxygen levels are so low that any skydiver would need a good enough portable oxygen supply. There are many important reasons, all of which are discussed in this video.

130,vMwvOvQO7Aw,Science ABC,7 Scientifically Inaccurate Things They Show in Movies: Most Common Movie Mistakes and Myths,"Movie mistakes are an inherent part of any movie - it’s almost impossible to make movies without taking certain “creative liberties” to enrich and supplement the plot. In this video, we’ll take a look at some common movie myths that don’t hold up in real life.

Chloroform - movies love this chemical. But the way chloroform use is portrayed in movies is far from technically accurate. Guns! Another object that movies can’t get enough of. But there are so many firearms-related mistakes. How about the human brain? Do we use only 10 percent of it? Only 33 percent maybe? 

Talk about sci-fi movies set in space - they usually have spacecraft running and darting around celestial objects. Is that an accurate depiction of how celestial bodies exist in space?

131,u9D-7ZdV89w,Science ABC,Why Venus and Mercury have no Moons?,"Mercury and Venus have no moons because of their close proximity to the Sun. Any moon orbiting around them is likely be swallowed by the mammoth gravitational pull of the mighty Sun.
All planets except for Mercury and Venus have moons. In fact, Earth is the only planet to have just one moon; remaining planets from Mars onward have multiple moons, with Saturn having as much as 82 moons! So when most of the planets are inundated moons, why do Venus and Mercury have no moons?

The moonlessness of Venus and Mercury is mostly attributed to their proximity to the sun. Being so close to the sun means that they’re not only exposed to a lot of hostile solar radiation, but also experience the intense gravitational pull of the massive star nearby. For Mercury, the planet is simply too close to the Sun and also too small to have any sustainable gravitational influence to secure a moon in orbit. As for Venus, its slow retrograde rotation makes it challenging for any moon to stay in its orbit.

132,m0yu4y-y7kI,Science ABC,What Does It Take To Make Vaccines?,"Since vaccination was discovered in 1769 by Edward Jenner, it has come to become an indispensable part of healthcare. Over the last 50 years, advances in science and technology have allowed us to develop vaccines to  diseases at breakneck speed, but the process is still long and each disease and pathogen pose its own unique challenges.

On average, developing a vaccine for a completely new disease can take 8 years or more. Performing basic research to understand the pathogen, choosing the right vaccine strategy and then performing clinical trials all while ensuring the vaccine is safe and works well is a lengthy process.
For diseases such as the flu, past research has now made it possible for vaccine developers to design a new vaccine for a flu in a year’s time. There is similar hope that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be ready within a year due to the research already conducted in the past on other coronaviruses.

A note on clinical trials:

The structure of a clinical trial isn’t set in stone. Depending on various factors such as whether a vaccine is a new formulation or whether it is completely new, or for what disease the vaccine treats, the finer details of the clinical trials might vary. Every clinical trial might not be a double blind trial, although that is the gold standard. Additionally, phase I and phase II might not have a placebo in some instances.

133,7NDtaxq94sM,Science ABC,Are Zebras Black with White Stripes or White with Black Stripes?,"Zebras are actually black with white stripes. All animals get their colors from pigments called melanin which are of two kinds - eumelanin gives a black to brown color which pheomelanin gives reddish to yellow hues. The cells that create this pigment, melanocytes have certain genes that control when the pigment is made. Once the pigment is made, it is shipped to the skin or hair to give the latter color. 

When scientists looked at zebra embryos developing, they found that all melanocytes had pigment creating genes were turned on. These genes were selectively turned off in areas designated to be white stripes!
Underneath the black and white fur, a zebra’s skin is black. Melanocytes that give pigment to hair that differently controlled that melanocytes that give pigment to skin.

134,gWvVvdwAH8g,Science ABC,What Are Asteroids And Where Do They Come From?,"Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun, just like the rest of the planets and celestial bodies in our solar system. Although asteroids are present throughout the solar system, most of them live in the asteroid belt—a region located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The size of objects within the asteroid belt have a wide range, from being no bigger than a dust particle to almost a thousand kilometers wide. Our solar system came into existence about 4.6 billion years ago when a large cloud of gas and dust collapsed. 

Following this event, most of that material fell to the center of the cloud and resulted in the formation of the sun—the central star of our solar system. Planets were formed from some of the condensing dust in that cloud, but not all celestial material had the chance to be incorporated into planets. The leftovers from that time took the form of asteroids.

135,dfsbspNlI14,Science ABC,Kindchenschema: Why Do We Find Babies Cute?,"Babies are cute because of their face structure and their sounds. Adult brains find the faces features of babies' faces cute. This signature cute baby face is called Kindchenschema (or baby scheme in English). Our brains seemed to be hardwired to find baby features cute and this is probably related to survival. We are compelled by the power of the baby’s cuteness to care and nurture for it. This works out great when you consider that many mammal’s baby’s take many months and years to be able to fend for themselves. 
This power of cuteness isn’t limited to survival. The spillover effects are that cuteness and taking care of a baby might make us more empathetic and there is even research to show that looking at cute things, even cute fictional characters might boost our concentration.

So, there you go! Look at a few cute kittens and then get back to work.

A note on Konrad Lorenz:

Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist and widely considered the father of animal behaviour studies. He’s famous for his duck imprinting experiments among others. But, he has some shady facets to his life. During the 1940s, Lorenz applied for application to the Nazi party and even contributed. Later in his life though, he is recorded to have regretted his involvement with the party and his work for them, expressing that he didn’t really know the extent of the atrocities. Many science historians have wondered to what extent his work was influenced by his affiliations with the party and its Nationalist Socialist ideology.

136,Yj240oulsc8,Science ABC,Coriolis Effect: How Hurricanes Form & Why they Spin in different ways in North and South Hemisphere,"Hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are formed due to violent storms that originate over oceans and seas and move towards land, potentially causing extensive damage to both life and property. But there is a very interesting thing related to hurricanes - they spin counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere but clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Why does that happen? 


You may already know that hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are different names for the same natural phenomenon—a tropical cyclone. In essence, they’re all very violent storms that originate over oceans and seas and move towards land. They are caused by pre-existing weather disturbances, moist and warm air, warm tropical oceans and relatively light winds. 



In the southern hemisphere, winds traveling towards the equator are diverted towards the east. Similarly, in the northern hemisphere, winds traveling towards the equator are diverted towards east, because earth rotates from west to east. This causes hurricanes to spin in different directions in both hemispheres.



In this video, we explain hurricanes, why and how they form and why they spin in different directions in different hemispheres.

Why Does Everyone Float In This Sea?","Lying on the lowest point on the Earth, the hypersaline Dead Sea is one of the most fascinating places on this planet. People float effortlessly here and that is the major attraction of the Dead Sea. But besides this natural buoyancy, unique environmental characteristics, abundance of salt and minerals, and the conspicuous absence of natural flora and fauna have piqued the interest of researchers and science enthusiasts for decades. With a salinity above 342g/kg, it makes it very difficult for usual marine life to thrive in this water. That's why it is called the 'Dead' sea.

The most riveting part about the Dead Sea is that you can keep floating in the Dead Sea automatically even if you don't know swimming! High salinity makes Dead Sea water denser than a human body. Thus, people naturally float in the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea also feels very different than other water bodies. It feels greasy and oily. Moreover, you cannot really ‘swim’ or ‘dive’ in the dead sea on account of its dense saline water. You simply stay afloat and enjoy the surreal feel!

138,rUogIRH2XwQ,Science ABC,How to live without a heart or a brain - Lessons from a Jellyfish,"The jellyfish is one weird sea animal. What makes it even weirder is that it doesn’t have a brain or a heart. Though it doesn’t have a brain, it does have a nervous system in the form of nerve nets and some have a structure called a nerve ring. This allows the jellyfish to reflexively respond to its surroundings. Some jellyfish like box jellyfish even have structures similar to a human eye that can see in 3-D images located inside the edge of their bell. 

The jellyfish also don’t have a heart and neither do they need it. In animals with a heart, the heart functions to distribute oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. For the jellyfish, oxygen simply diffuses from the water into their cells. Similarly with food, the jellyfish has a rudimentary stomach, called the gastroventricular cavity where food is digested and nutrients are directly absorbed into the jellyfish. 

*Nature or evolution aren’t conscious decision makers, designing life as they see fit. Evolution is a phenomenon where random genetic mutations create changes in traits over many generations.

The process repeats the next day, as sunflowers return to their ‘starting’ position, i.e. facing east. Ancient Greeks knew about this phenomenon, and they called such plants Heliotropium, meaning “sun turn”. Today, we call this phenomenon heliotropism. So, how do sunflowers face the sun? Also, do all sunflowers face the sun?

140,mR0UhUnSUmo,Science ABC,What are fossils? Do bones decompose? How long does it take for bones to decompose?,"Ever wonder why bones can survive hundreds of years without decomposing? This is due to the unique composition of bone. Bone is primarily composed of a very stable protein called collagen and the mineral calcium. The association between collagen and calcium makes bone very sturdy. Many microbes and insects that feed on dead matter find it difficult to digest bone. But, over many months and even years, bones eventually decompose. But, certain environmental conditions preserve bones. Dry, arid conditions as well as acidic soil are great preservers of organic matter. 
The dinosaur bones that survive millions of years, aren’t really bones anymore. They are stones - fossils! Overtime, all the organic matter got decomposed and minerals from the water and soil around the bone deposited on the bone creating a stone replica of the bone that once was!

141,sTUYvQl6_bs,Science ABC,Here's Why You Should NEVER Mix Bleach and Ammonia,"Ammonia and bleach are very popular for cleaning surfaces. However, the fact that you should NEVER mix ammonia and bleach is so well-known because their combination may lead to the formation of dangerous, potentially hazardous byproducts as a result of certain chemical reactions that occur between the two compounds, Since sodium hypochlorite is the active ingredient in chlorine-based bleach, it may first decompose to form hydrochloric acid, which can then lead to the formation of chloramine vapors. Exposure to these toxic gases can trigger symptoms like irritation to the eyes and nose and coughing and shortness of breath. So, never mix ammonia and bleach!

142,zNmbD8fSt88,Science ABC,Why Don't We Have Pet Foxes?,"Both foxes and dogs belong to the same family Canidae. Then why haven’t foxes become our companions too?

To answer this, in 1950, a group of Russian scientists began an experiment to try and create the first ever pet fox species. The study led by Russian geneticist Dmitry K. Belyaev started out to understand how animals are domesticated.

There is some evidence that early humans did try to tame the fox. But foxes are very shy and chaotic animals. In comparison, the wolf might have been easier to domesticate. This might be one reason that they weren’t domesticated.  

The Russian fox farm experiment showed that it is possible to tame the fox. They are now investigating which genes might make some animals like the dogs friendly towards humans but others like foxes aggressive.

143,n7tnHPDH5d8,Science ABC,Lunar and Solar Eclipse Explained: A Beginner’s Guide to Eclipses,"Solar and lunar eclipses are celestial phenomena that occur when the sun, moon and Earth align in a way that either the moon casts a shadow on Earth or the latter casts a shadow on the moon. So what are the similarities and differences between lunar and solar eclipse? 

Just as Earth moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit every year, our natural satellite—the moon—also revolves around the Earth. It takes about 27.322 days for the moon to complete one revolution around our planet. Due to all the inter-related motion happening between these three celestial bodies, several physical phenomena occur. When the new moon, during its revolution around the Earth, moves between the sun and the Earth, it blocks out the sun’s rays, which casts a shadow on parts of the planet. This is called an eclipse of the sun or a solar eclipse. In other words, a solar eclipse happens when the moon passes in a direct line between the sun and the Earth. 

Since the moon continuously revolves around the Earth, it’s only natural that it sometimes comes between the sun and the Earth, while at other times it goes BEHIND the Earth, so that the Earth comes between the moon and the sun. When the latter happens, we see a lunar eclipse.


Watch this video to learn everything you need to know about solar and lunar eclipses.

144,I_cOqxZqjFU,Science ABC,How Do Astronauts Get Breathable Oxygen In Space (Aboard The ISS)?,"Astronauts onboard the ISS get their breathable oxygen in two main ways - through systems onboard the ISS that generate breathable oxygen and through resupply missions that deliver breathable oxygen to the ISS.



There is plenty of oxygen on Earth; but things change drastically as you breach the ‘boundary’ of the sky and reach the blackness of space. Oxygen is hard to come by in space, that’s why space engineers figured out a way to provide sufficient quantities of oxygen to astronauts that head to space and stay up there for months on end. Aboard the ISS, there are two systems that provide breathable oxygen to astronauts - NASA’s ECLSS and Russia’s Elektron. These two are referred to as oxygen generators, as they provide breathable oxygen through electrolysis of water. 


Check out this video for more details about ways through which astronauts get oxygen in space.

145,gBUjzm6w7Hs,Science ABC,Photosynthesis: The Biochemistry Behind How Plants Make Their Food,"Plants, unlike most living things, produce their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis means 'making using light'. Plants use the energy from the sunlight to make food. The food matter comes from carbon dioxide present in the air. These processes take place in a special compartment of a plant cell called the chloroplast.
Photosynthesis takes place in two steps, that can happen simultaneously in a plant cell. The first is light-dependent reactions which take place in structures called thylakoid present inside the chloroplast. In these reactions, pigments such as chlorophyll absorb light. Through a series of enzymatic reactions, the plant produces ATP, its energy currency and NADPH, a reducing molecule required to build the food. 
The second step is light-independent reactions. Here, the carbon dioxide taken into the cell is converted into food such as sugars which can further be converted into proteins, fats, or nucleic acids. Plants perform these reactions in the stroma of the chloroplast. 
The process of photosynthesis powers life. It converts a molecule that isn't food, carbon dioxide, into something we can derive energy from, sugars. In the process, oxygen is given out creating a favorable environment for us to live in. This is a feat of engineering humans could only dream of designing.

146,YJBhWVDArLo,Science ABC,How Does A Helicopter Work: Everything You Need To Know About Helicopters,"A helicopter works on the principle of aerodynamic lift - an upwards force that opposes the weight of the helicopter and holds it the air. So how exactly do the rotors of helicopters help them fly?

For any object to fly in the air, it must have the force of lift pushing it upwards, but for that to happen, the air must pass around an airfoil. In the case of a chopper, the airfoil is its main rotor wings. The blades of a chopper are uniquely designed so that they can generate lift; more specifically, they are curved on top and flatter at the bottom. 

This curved shape makes air flow faster over the top, which causes the air pressure on top of the blades to decrease. These wings rotate at a very high speed which causes air to pass over them in such a way that lift is generated due to Bernoulli’s principle. 

Helicopters steer in a given direction by generating more lift on one side than the other. Basically, when they need to go left, they generate more lift on the right and vice versa.

Some choppers can even fly upside down! An inverted chopper can use its blades to generate lift towards the bottom of the chopper the same way it normally uses them to generate lift upwards.

This video explains everything you need to know about helicopters.

147,intBEYKlaGY,Science ABC,"Rigor Mortis, Livor Mortis, Pallor Mortis, Algor Mortis: Forensic Science Explains Stages of Death","Once a person dies, their body begins a process of decay. This process can be seen through certain external changes which are called post mortem signs of death. There are 4 postmortem signs of death - pallor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and livor mortis in this order respectively. All these changes occur in the first 24-48 hours after death.
Pallor mortis is the first sign. It is when the skin becomes pale because of lack of blood flow to the skin.
Algor mortis is the second sign. It is the change in body temperature post mortem to reach external temperatures.
Rigor mortis is the 3rd stage. In this stage all the muscles stiffen because of cellular degradation called autolysis. It is preceded by primary flaccidity where all the muscles relax because the brain does not send the muscles signals to contract. As cellular degradation continues, it sets the onset of a second phase of relaxation called secondary flaccidity. This whole cycle can take for 24 hours.
Lastly, livor mortis is the pooling of blood due to gravity that appears as a purple colouration.
All these signs are used by forensic experts to determine time of death.

148,-7oVWSPBJY8,Science ABC,Why Is Space Cold If There Are So Many Stars?,"Space is filled with countless stars, all of which radiate enormous amounts of heat. These stars are tens of thousands of times bigger than our own sun. Still, space is considered to be cold. Why is that? If there are so many hot burning stars in space, why is space so cold?
From a purely technical standpoint, it’s not fair to say that space is cold in itself. Because technically, space is just a vacuum, and vacuum doesn't have a temperature of its own. It’s the objects in space that become cold in due time because they continuously lose heat due to radiation.
In addition to that, it’s not like all these stars are clumped up together. These stars are extremely hot, sure, but they are so far apart and have so much space between them that it’s simply impossible for them to heat up space. It is totally different from what you see when you look up at the night sky. In a nutshell, space is cold, despite having so many stars, because
space contains such an incomprehensibly large amount of
nothingness.

149,bugvN7sHN6E,Science ABC,Tensor Tympani Muscle: Why Do You Hear A Rumbling Sound When You Close Your Eyes Too Hard?,"The tensor tympani muscle is a tiny muscle in the middle ear that helps dampens external sounds falling on the ear. The tensor tympani muscle originates from the Eustachian tube, which is also known as the auditory tube. From there, this muscle attaches to the malleus bone—one of the three tiny bones located within the middle ear. This malleus bone looks like a little hammer, and the tensor tympani muscle attaches to the handle of this hammer. 

Tensor Tympani muscle is the reason behind that rumbling sound some people hear between their ears when they shut their eyes really tightly. It is the sound of the tensor tympani muscle stretching. This muscle is also responsible for dampening the sound of our own chewing.

Although the tensor tympani muscle is good at dampening loud, gradual sounds, but it is not so effective in softening up loud, sudden noises, like a gunshot or an explosion. This muscle activates involuntarily, but some people can hear its rumbling sound between their ears by squinting hard.

150,fqnmUNzn5N8,Science ABC,Hawking Radiation Explained: What Exactly Was Stephen Hawking Famous For?,"Hawking radiation was first discovered by English scientist Stephen Hawking in 1974. Prior to this discovery, our knowledge of black holes was very limited. It was believed that black holes were completely black and that they did not emit any kind of radiation. Astronomers had a very basic understanding of black holes; they believed that black holes radiate no energy of any sort. 

But thanks to Stephen Hawking’s discovery of the Hawking radiation, it was learned that black holes were not really black and could, in fact, emit radiation! His theory claimed that the mass of a black hole can become energy, and then that energy can be radiated away. 

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, for every particle throughout the universe, there exists an antiparticle. These particles always exist in pairs and keep popping in and out of existence everywhere in the universe. So when a particle and antiparticle pair pop in existence near the event horizon of a black hole, things become very interesting. The antiparticle gets sucked into the black hole while the particle is radiated away.

Learn more about the Hawking radiation and black holes in this short animated video.

151,y_cWTWB-N_I,Science ABC,Current Vs Voltage: How Much Current Can Kill You?,"Voltage vs current, or sometimes it's current vs voltage; we are constantly trying to understand the differences between these two entities related to electricity. Then, there is sometimes one more entity: resistance. How do these three entities, i.e. current, voltage and resistance play together to cause electric shocks? And more importantly, how much current or voltage can be lethal to you?
It’s very important to understand that it’s not only the current that is fatal to you. Current won’t flow in an electric circuit if there is no potential difference between two points. Also, the current has to flow for a long duration at a specific frequency for it to be lethal to humans. The point of contact of the electric shock also plays a key role in determining if the electric shock is fatal. Similarly, the state of the skin (wet skin or dry skin) plays a crucial role as well.
There’s a lot of confusion between current and voltage when it comes to which is lethal, or which is the more harmful one. You may have also heard the saying that “it’s not the volts that kill you, it’s the amps” - what does the phrase really mean? Find out in this video!

Basketballs bounce a lot, but plastic balls don’t. Some objects are inherently bouncier than others. Why is that so? The answer lies in a property of the material which is known as the coefficient of restitution. The coefficient of restitution of a racquetball shall be different from the coefficient of restitution of a tennis ball. In this video, we give a layman explanation of what the coefficient of restitution is, and how does it make stuff bouncy.

158,q2XobbUQHXA,Science ABC,Cherenkov Radiation: What If Something Travels Faster Than The Speed Of Light?,"What is Cherenkov radiation and how is it related to the speed of light? Can anything travel faster than the speed of light? Is it even possible for something to undertake the “speed of light” travel? And what if something can actually travel faster than light? 

These are some of the most popular questions related to the speed of light and the plausibility of a light-speed travel. Well, as of now, it’s not possible for humans to travel at the speed of light. 

You may have heard people saying that nothing travels faster than the speed of light. Well, that statement is not entirely correct, unless the medium of light’s travel is specified too. It’s true that light travels the fastest, but that’s true only when it travels through a vacuum. Because in other mediums, like water, there are things that can travel faster than the speed of light. This is what Cherenkov radiation is all about. 

Cherenkov radiation is observed when something travels faster than the speed of light in a given medium. It’s a bluish glow that you can see in the water of nuclear reactors. Just like you hear a sonic boom when something travels faster than the speed of sound, Cherenkov radiation is observed when something travels faster than the speed of light.

159,gOWt_Hq3yrE,Science ABC,What is Entropy and Why is it Predicted to Cause the Heat Death of the Universe?,"Heat death of the universe, also called The Big Chill or Big Freeze, will happen when the entropy of the universe will be so high that everything and everyone that lives in it will perish. This will happen because an organism living in the universe wouldn't be able to extract order from its surroundings, because the latter would be more disordered than the organism itself. 


The death of the universe can occur in more ways than one, and this is one of the ways that some researchers and space scientists theorize that could be the reason behind the end of the entire universe.

Everything that has a beginning must also have an end. While we know the Universe sprung to life 13 billion years ago, we don't know when its illustrious journey will come to an end. What we do know is one of the ways it could happen. We call this plausible ultimate fate of the Universe Heat Death, and entropy is the culprit.

According to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy in the Universe can only increase, and it is this increase that will eventually cause its demise. Entropy is also why we cannot generate infinite energy. But what is entropy? And why should it only increase? How does it prevent us from generating infinite energy? And most importantly, why should its increase lead to the apocalypse? 


In this short animated video for kids, we explain the concept of entropy in simple, basic language.

In this short and simple video, we discuss the science of how rockets work. It is a short animated video for kids and laymen to understand the basics of a rocket launch. 

Rocket science is considered a highly technical, or even scary subject by many. But in reality, it’s not that complicated. Rocket launches are elaborate processes, which consist of a number of small, basic steps that need to be accomplished properly in order to reach the desired end result - the successful launch of the rocket.

A rocket is, in simple terms, a vehicle that is powered by rocket engines. NASA and other space agencies all over the world, including ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization), JAXA (Japanese Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russian Space Agency), ESA (European Space Agency) and CNSA have been involved in sending rockets into space for decades now. A rocket consists of three main parts - the guidance system, payload system and propulsion system. We discuss these systems in more detail in this short, simple video designed for kids.

What is a transistor? The transistor is arguably the greatest invention of the last century, or perhaps, one of the greatest of all time. If it wasn't for transistors, we couldn't have developed smaller, faster and cheaper computers, telephones, GPS devices, radios, gaming consoles, smart televisions, routers and a device -- no larger than a human hand -- that integrates all these marvels under the same screen. 

This is a short, layman explanation of what is a transistor and how it works.

This video has an immune system animation. The innate immune system consists of defenses against infection that are activated instantly as a pathogen attacks. Adaptive immunity (or acquired immunity) is a subsystem of the immune system that contains highly specialised systemic cells and processes that kill pathogens and prevent their growth in the body. Innate vs adaptive immunity: it’s important to realize that innate and adaptive immunity are different. Their differences are explained in the video in layman terms.

Our immune system is a fascinating entity, that functions in quite a unique and efficient manner. Comprising of various types of cells, it is prepared for any kind of breach in the fortress of our body, and is equipped to fight off a staggering number of intruders.
In this video, we give you a brief overview of the immune system, and the basic types of cells involved, along with the function they carry out.

Each cell if the immune system carries out various roles, depending on the kind of threat the body is facing. However, they have certain basic roles which have been explained here.

163,c-MfcZFmGTY,Science ABC,Newton’s Second Law: Spiderman And The Death Of Gwen Stacy,"Did you know that Gwen stacy's death and Newton’s second law of motion have a connection? In the comics “The Amazing Spiderman”, Gwen Stacy dies after she is pushed off a bridge. Spiderman jumps behind her to catch her in his webbing, but he couldn’t save her. This entire situation that involves the death of Gwen Stacy is connected to the second law of motion postulated by Newton. 

Every individual on earth, whether they are a regular fellow or a superhero, are bound by the three laws of motion proposed by eminent scientist Sir Isaac Newton. In this video, we are going to discuss how Spiderman, a popular Marvel world superhero, learnt the application of the second law of motion through a heartbreaking incident - the death of Gwen Stacy - his girlfriend.

Newton’s second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. In one of the editions of the Amazing Spiderman comic series, Gwen Stacy is thrown off a bridge. Spiderman shoots his web to catch her, and he does catch her too. But to his utter shock and dismay, it's his web that ultimately resulted in the death of Gwen Stacy.

Let's look at how it all happened and how Spiderman changed his tactic of saving free falling victims after learning the proper application of the second law of motion.

This video inspired by a chapter in the book “The Physics of Superheroes” authored by James Kakalios - a physics professor at the University of Minnesota.

Albert Einstein is the most popular physicist, as he formulated the theory of relativity, which gave the Energy mass equivalence formula and is directly related to time dilation. But what is time dilation? Time dilation and space time are interrelated. Einstein made one of the most important contributions to physics and had the concept of space time explained. A simple explanation of space time is that it is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. But it is very important to understand that the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are different. In this short animated video, we give a simple explanation of time dilation and Einstein’s theory of relativity and also explain how time slows down in a moving vehicle!

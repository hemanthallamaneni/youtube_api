5,Xp5p5ATmKi4,ClimateScience - Solve Climate Change,Floating Communities??? #Shorts,"Floating cities may sound like fantasy, but some designers are actually beginning to create structures that embrace rising sea levels. Global sea level rise is expected to exceed two meters by the end of the century if no serious climate action is taken [8]. This has the potential to displace approximately 200 million people [8]. With increasing sea level rise, adaptation solutions to combat it have become essential [7] one of them being floating structures! 

Floating architecture may serve as a solution due to its relatively low economic and logistical maintainability. These afloat settlements could provide safe, climate-resilient housing for flood-stricken communities. Do you think floating architecture could be the game changer in combating sea level rise? Let us know in the comments!

7,36hohyrQrP8,ClimateScience - Solve Climate Change,Undo Climate Change? #Shorts,"1 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide. That’s the amount we’d need to remove if we want to undo climate change. That's roughly the same weight as one blue whale for every person on Earth! [3,11]

Think of carbon removal as a pollution cleanup operation. For it to work, CO₂ must be captured from the atmosphere and stored away safely and permanently without emitting more along the way [1]. 

There are lots of ways to do this: soil carbon sequestration; direct air capture; geological carbon storage; enhanced weathering and more [4,5,6,7].

But it’s really important to remember: we can’t let dreams of carbon sequestration delay emissions reduction today. 

Were there any carbon removal methods you were curious about and would like us to cover more deeply? Let us know in the comments! Bye!

“We know this from studying ancient ice cores”:
https://icecores.org/about-ice-cores

“By analyzing these tiny trapped bubbles of air and knowing how deep they were we can learn about the concentration of CO2 in the air at a given time in the past!“:
https://icecores.org/about-ice-cores 

“Because of these ice cores we can be pretty sure that the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today is higher than it has been in the past 800,000 years.”:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

“ We also know that the rate at which the ppm of co2 is increasing is higher than past rates.”
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

“Today, scientists across the globe have set up measuring towers and ocean buoys to record global temperatures 24/7. And guess what? These temperatures have been steadily rising.”:
https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ten-signs-global-warming 

“We’ve seen glaciers retreating, reduced snow cover, a decline in arctic sea ice, and a resulting rise in sea levels.”:
https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 

“From these models, it's clear that the global changes we are seeing right now cannot be explained by natural phenomena.”:

Today’s episode will explain how a sudden increase in greenhouse gases has resulted in a warming planet that could prove deadly to millions.

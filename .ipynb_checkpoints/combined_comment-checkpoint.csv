Frank Baxter of The Bell System Science Series E.g.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHVTQ2fLM0 was first. This alarmist video was plagiarized by Al Gore.\r\n\r\nThe claim that CO2 was a ""heat trapping gas"" was scuttlebutt at that time. Alarmists presented no knowledge of the X10 CO2 level during the late Ordovician while a global glaciation prevailed, as revealed by drop stones in Sahara and Saudi Arabia. CO2 is NOT a ""heat trapping gas"". This claim comes from the \'authority\' of Al Gore, psychopath, businessman. Al Gore took only one science course from Oceanographer Roger Revelle. They argued. Journalism records this snippet of history. Regrettably journalist historians did not report what grade student Al Gore was awarded, while a student at Harvard?\r\n\r\nAs a psychopath businessman Al Gore became excited with the business opportunities provided by Carl Sagan’s “Greenhouse”. Sagan’s “Greenhouse” was repudiated by Carl Sagan himself and his colleague Bishun Khare when they did chemical analysis of ‘Tholin’, using Infrared Spectroscopy and other techniques. Infrared Spectroscopy deals with Infrared radiation emitted and absorbed. For understanding IR radiation, there are the Beer-Lambert Laws. The absorption depth of IR radiation in air is measured at 1.0 cm. The highway mirage, Forrest M. Mims III\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060218195616/http://www.sas.org/tcs/weeklyIssues/2004-09-10/gallery/index.html \r\n\r\n‘Black asphalt highways form a perfect substrate for the production of mirages. As the sun illuminates the pavement, its temperature rises significantly. The hot asphalt then warms a thin layer of air over the pavement. Warm air has a lower index of refraction than cool air.’\r\n\r\nAl Gore has revealed himself to be an uneducated psychopathic moron. Who would believe what he says? Enough did believe him, that he earned $300 million$ which he invested in Southern California real estate. It appears he can no longer pay the property taxes.\r\n\r\nLet’s analyze according to the Ideal Gas Law:\r\n\r\nPV=nRT\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\nP=pressure\r\nV=Volume\r\nn=number of Moles\r\nR=Ideal Gas Constant = In terms of SI base units:\r\nR = 8.314462618... kg⋅m2⋅s−2⋅K−1⋅mol−1.\r\n\r\nThe Ideal Gas Law says that hot air rises, moist hot air rises faster (water vapor is less dense than air and so experiences a greater buoyancy force.)\r\n\r\nConsider Al Gore’s brain diseased ‘heat trapping gas’. It needs a negative buoyancy force. It is inconsistent with the Ideal Gas Law. The claim that carbon dioxide is a ‘heat trapping gas’ is inconsistent with fact of the later Ordovician Era when CO2 was X10 present levels during a worldwide glaciation, shown by drop stones in Sahara and Saudi Arabia.', 'Animals deserve better', 'Mother Nature deserves better', 'Love this', 'This is such an important message!']"

Someone needs to look into the emissions model estimates as it is not all that clear cut. Many small holder farmers still have small amounts of livestock that are fed with farm produce that cannot be sold or are farm wastes. Rise in the demand for plant based products actually contributed to more farm produce that cannot be sold - consumers usually only pick the nice shiny ones and those that do not make the quality cut are processed or fed to livestock. As for farm wastes, rice bran for example is mixed with feed and rather than letting it decompose, it is used for another purpose to feed animals. This metric on 77% of land used to create 18% of calories also needs to be reviewed since a lot of feed inputs are again wastes being used for another purpose. The opportunity cost way of looking at this problem does not include waste management being used for some other purpose (as input to another process). There are many other examples of farm wastes being used as inputs for animal feed. Then there is the issue of livestock being used in the farm not just to produce meat but as part of the ecosystem - keeping grass cut as to not make an environment for snakes to thrive or ducks eating snails to control snail rice pests. In this case livestock is actually a contributor to make soil richer and make the farm more biodiverse. As for biotechnology on growing meat, how will that play in developing countries? Foster more import culture? Well... there goes accumulation of wealth. This is one of those things that are in the not so simple in life category.']"

The carbon tax has not reduced emissions AT ALL.  In fact emissions have increased.  The trick they use is it was reduced from ""what it would have been"" ie from a computer projection based on past consumption (a guess) that did not take into account other factors that also reduce consumption.  Yes, lower income households do get some more money back, but the fact of the matter is the ""rich"" actually pay less anyway as they leave during winter to warm jurisdictions and avoid the carbon tax anyway (we tend to refer to these people as snow birds).  So who really pays....  The working middle class.  What has the carbon tax really done?  It is a SIGNIFICANT contributor to inflation and the high cost of living particularly in BC. As part of that those who can now burn wood and/or garbage for fuel sources.  These are ""unofficial"" CO2 sources so the ""official"" consumption has gone down, but at best the actual CO2 production is the same or more considering burning wood or garbage for fuel is very inefficient.  It has also significantly contributed to cross boarder shopping mostly into Norther Washington USA where the fuel and products are much more affordable even with our low dollar taken into account.  Other problems are healthy foods like fresh vegetables have gone up significantly in price because of the transport costs.   Forcing families to either forgo or eat (ironically) more processed less healthy foods.  And the high cost of living (among several other factors) has also lead to the extremely high homeless and drug problem in Vancouver in particular.  The economy grew in BC due to demand in LNG and other natural resources (BC has a large forestry industry), and tech centers in Vancouver.  It has not grown as much as it could have mostly due to high taxes, and Provincial and Federal political policies that have limited the economy.  It is above the Canadian average, but it always has been.  I note you did not mention Quebec who also has a carbon tax, but due to it\'s welfare state policies and the rest of Canada\'s monetary support it does not have the higher cost of living, but it also has a stagnant economy.

Someone needs to look into the emissions model estimates as it is not all that clear cut. Many small holder farmers still have small amounts of livestock that are fed with farm produce that cannot be sold or are farm wastes. Rise in the demand for plant based products actually contributed to more farm produce that cannot be sold - consumers usually only pick the nice shiny ones and those that do not make the quality cut are processed or fed to livestock. As for farm wastes, rice bran for example is mixed with feed and rather than letting it decompose, it is used for another purpose to feed animals. This metric on 77% of land used to create 18% of calories also needs to be reviewed since a lot of feed inputs are again wastes being used for another purpose. The opportunity cost way of looking at this problem does not include waste management being used for some other purpose (as input to another process). There are many other examples of farm wastes being used as inputs for animal feed. Then there is the issue of livestock being used in the farm not just to produce meat but as part of the ecosystem - keeping grass cut as to not make an environment for snakes to thrive or ducks eating snails to control snail rice pests. In this case livestock is actually a contributor to make soil richer and make the farm more biodiverse. As for biotechnology on growing meat, how will that play in developing countries? Foster more import culture? Well... there goes accumulation of wealth. This is one of those things that are in the not so simple in life category.']"

The carbon tax has not reduced emissions AT ALL.  In fact emissions have increased.  The trick they use is it was reduced from ""what it would have been"" ie from a computer projection based on past consumption (a guess) that did not take into account other factors that also reduce consumption.  Yes, lower income households do get some more money back, but the fact of the matter is the ""rich"" actually pay less anyway as they leave during winter to warm jurisdictions and avoid the carbon tax anyway (we tend to refer to these people as snow birds).  So who really pays....  The working middle class.  What has the carbon tax really done?  It is a SIGNIFICANT contributor to inflation and the high cost of living particularly in BC. As part of that those who can now burn wood and/or garbage for fuel sources.  These are ""unofficial"" CO2 sources so the ""official"" consumption has gone down, but at best the actual CO2 production is the same or more considering burning wood or garbage for fuel is very inefficient.  It has also significantly contributed to cross boarder shopping mostly into Norther Washington USA where the fuel and products are much more affordable even with our low dollar taken into account.  Other problems are healthy foods like fresh vegetables have gone up significantly in price because of the transport costs.   Forcing families to either forgo or eat (ironically) more processed less healthy foods.  And the high cost of living (among several other factors) has also lead to the extremely high homeless and drug problem in Vancouver in particular.  The economy grew in BC due to demand in LNG and other natural resources (BC has a large forestry industry), and tech centers in Vancouver.  It has not grown as much as it could have mostly due to high taxes, and Provincial and Federal political policies that have limited the economy.  It is above the Canadian average, but it always has been.  I note you did not mention Quebec who also has a carbon tax, but due to it\'s welfare state policies and the rest of Canada\'s monetary support it does not have the higher cost of living, but it also has a stagnant economy.

Composing a 10000-word essay is beyond the scope of this chat. However, I can give you a brief overview of blood cells.\n\nBlood cells are essential components of the circulatory system, responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste throughout the body. There are three main types of blood cells: red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes).\n\nRed blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to various tissues and organs, while white blood cells play a crucial role in the immune system, defending the body against infections and diseases. Platelets aid in blood clotting, helping to stop bleeding from wounds.\n\nEach type of blood cell has specific functions, and their proper balance is vital for overall health. Any abnormalities in blood cell production or function can lead to various medical conditions.

Meaning, once an object gains so much mass that a threshold that gets passed where its gravity is strong enough to teleport the photon so fast from point a to point b that we just can’t see it physically speaking as it travels it’s orbit around the black hole. That’s why some of these black holes have rings of light on them emulating from the elliptical orbit of these photons .

Your videos help to keep our eyes focused on the critical reasons why we need to co-create better solutions.  As individuals, communities, nations, and as residents on our one-and-only planet, we desperately need a much better accounting of our living energy currency, - not just an accounting of our monetary currency.\n\nThe currency of all life here on Earth is “living energy.”  The living energy in our soils, and water, is needed to give birth to the plants humans need for survival.  Without that living energy, our soils would become only dirt and sand. Without soil biology, it becomes only geology - like Mars.  The valuable living energy currency of individual human beings is being devalued, wasted, and diverted.  The accounting valuation of monetary currency, increasingly devalues our living energy currency.  Our currency accounting system does not reflect the reality of what it takes for humanity to co-creatively sustain human life, on our planet.  Our current currency strategy is increasingly moving to a self-destructive goal, of increasingly devaluing all living energy currency.  \n\nLike a doctor, who only sees the symptoms, and waits for the test results, for a diagnosis, we are all sharing an experience of the awkward transition time of conscious (rather than unconscious) ignorance.  It’s also a time just before beautiful transitions for healing and marvelous new discoveries.\n\nAll of our “living energy currency” (environmental and human) is being severely depleted by climate change.  Past, present and future examples of an Economics of Compassion have protected our most valuable living energy currency.  For our present, and our future, we need to find many more, and better ways, for our monetary currency to support, and not threaten, our living energy currency.  \n\nPersonally, I’d love to explore a possibility of an individually-initiated economic currency, which would better enable human co-creative living energy currency. Individually initiated economic currency would be a biomimicry of the way each cell in our body has some limited degree of autonomy.  I wrote about this idea in our TTWalks message board in 2012 and called it a Jobs-Card, or J-Card.  It’s still online for anyone interested in Googling it.  I think this would better enable individual responses to co-creatively support both an environmental and human Economics of Compassion. Without this J-Card enablement, most individual responses are disabled.

That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible!  Also, bear in mind, that Water Vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas.  CO2 is only 5% of the earth's GHG; Water Vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.    Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El Nino) and oceans degas.  Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.  Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and Not a Thermostat."", 'This was good to mention the global warming benefits northern countries, we count too. Also if we eliminate global warming we will introduce another iced age.

Atmospheric pollutants are ""substances that accumulate in the air to a degree that is directly harmful to living organisms or to materials exposed to the air"".  CO2, at 420 ppm at present, does not \'directly\' harm living organisms exposed to the air. Rather, it helps warm the planet, and its the heat energy that is impacting negatively on living organisms.  CO2 is, after all, essential for all life on Earth.  We would not have O2 were it not for CO2 and the photosynthesis process. Plants came before all animals and insects, because it was CO2 that eventually provided enough O2 for animals to evolve.  CO2, prior to humans producing far too much through fossil fuels, helped keep Earth\'s climate in balance, around 15 degs. C.  Without GHGs, Earth\'s mean global temperature would hover around -20 degs. C, and life as we know it could not exist. \n\nFurthermore, water vapour, yes H2O, makes up about 50% of all GHGs. If global temperatures increased by 2 degs C, say from 15 to 17C, then H2O vapour would increased by almost 25%, which might be enough to put the climate over the top.  Therefore, if CO2 is a pollutant, then you must also include H2O vapour as a pollutant.  Where wpuld that leave you?  You should not lump CO2, H2O, and N2O in the same category of pollutants as CO,  SO2, and NO2.  I cannot fathom labelling something essential to all life as a pollutant!

The Earth\'s temperature very quickly spikes up 8 to 15 degrees Celcius, followed by at least 10,000 years of relatively stable warm temperatures.  This is then followed by a rapid decline in temperature leading to 80,000 to 90,000 years of glaciation where half of North America is covered by glaciers, during which time the Earth slowly gets colder.  Then the cycle repeats.  The last time we experienced rapid warming was about 11,000 years ago.  All of human civilization arose during this brief warm period, thanks in part to the fertile crescent in the Middle East making grains more available.\r\n\r\nWe should be in the cool-down phase by now, but anthropogenic greenhouse gases have at least temporarily delayed it.  It was predicted in the 1970s that we were entering a new ice age.  A period from 1500 to 1850 has been labeled ""the little ice age"", however, atmospheric CO2 levels started to go up in the 1800s.

Previous ice ages have caused massive declines in the human population.\r\n\r\nThese temperature cycles are caused by the roughly 5 different Malankovich cycles aligning with each other to produce rapid warming.  These cycles affect the Earth\'s orbit and its axial tilt.  The Earth is currently halfway between its maximum tilt and its minimum tilt, which has a 41,000-year cycle.  At the maximum tilt, the glaciers melt more, reducing the Earth\'s albedo, which means that less sunlight is reflected into space.  The increasing temperatures cause the oceans to release more of their stored CO2 into the atmosphere, which creates a temporary positive feedback loop.  The warming effect of CO2 in the atmosphere is logarithmic, which means that it reaches a saturation point, producing a temporarily stable warm climate.\r\n\r\nI don\'t understand why the cycle is every 100,000 years instead of every 41,000 years, and the Wikipedia article talks about this being an ""issue"" that they don\'t understand.

If they accept, then all the people in the area are to be made slaves.  If they refuse engage them in battle and lay siege to the city. When the Lord delivers the city to you, put the sword to all the men .  Everything else can be taken and used as plunder. \r\nAs for the nations the Lord promised and gave the Israelites , they were to completely destroy all the people and buildings, for otherwise  they will teach you to follow the detestable things they do in worshiping their  gods ,and you will sin against the Lord your God.\r\nJesus did not address the issue of how to handle the people who do not follow “the way” he indicates. He seemed to be more directed to how the humans could gain and continue to maintain a relationship to the Lord. \r\nSix hundred years plus, after Jesus, upon Muhammad’s death, many Muslims unfortunately abandoned his peace movement. They adopted the ways of the world, fighting for land and power. They built empires like everyone else. Many commandments of God were violated.

This defensive action was acceptable under the Muslim beliefs. \r\nHowever, the excesses of those empires pale in comparison with the horror inflicted by modern nation-states, which gave us World War I, II and the Holocaust.

If we wanted to have a much greater degree of confidence in our predictions, we would have to wait say another 100 years (arguably longer) and then look back over the previous 100 to refine our predictions. \n\nThis, I believe, is a MAJOR UNDERLYING WEAKNESS OF CLIMATE FORECASTING.

Also, I really think this could provide us with protection against a disaster so bad that global warming and nuclear war might seem minor in comparison, i.e., a major volcanic eruption, the size of the Krakatoa eruption of more than a 100 years ago or much bigger. As I understand it, the tectonic plate system that includes Yellowstone has been rebounding with the huge amount of melting of glaciers over it. Also, fracking is going on around Yellowstone, with resulting frequent earthquakes. A large eruption of Yellowstone can’t be ruled out within our lifetimes. And as bad as the ash, pyroclastic flow, and fire would be, it seems that the real killer is the huge release of sulfates into the stratosphere, where they could cause a decade or so of up to several degrees Celsius of cooling.

Knutson’s latest modeling study projects that the number of category-4 and category-5 hurricanes in the Atlantic will double by the end of this century, making a catastrophic storm like Katrina considerably more likely.\n\nKnutson notes several other worrisome trends for the hurricanes of the future as well. He warns that today’s climate models uniformly project that the hotter atmosphere brought about by global warming will retain more moisture. For developing hurricanes, this means more intense precipitation—some 20 percent higher rainfall rates, according to Knutson’s calculations.

How many neighbors will see these new solar panels and be inspired to act as well?  As climate activists we rarely get such a clear view of the positive impacts that we have on people.  Impacts which occur, even if we don’t hear about them.', ""I trained with Climate Reality Project, Chicago 2013 and am a liaison with Citizens Climate Lobby. Yesterday I gave a presentation to the Variety Boys and Girls Club of Boyle Heights (Los Angeles) with another CRP leader (Colorado 2017). Their leaders went over some Climate Science definitions i sent and then i created the definitions to post all over the room. We went over each one again as they came up in the presentation and they knew what most of what everything was. I was so very proud of them.

Johnson’s White House released “Restoring the Quality of our Environment”,\xa0a report that described the impacts of climate change, and foretold dramatic Antarctic ice sheet loss, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.\xa0 That 1965 White House report stated: “Carbon dioxide is being added to the earth’s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas at the rate of 6 billion tons a year. By the year 2000 there will be about 25 percent more CO2 in our atmosphere than present.”\nCatastrophically, on the 50th anniversary of the White House report, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are indeed at 399 ppm: 25 percent over 1965 levels, exactly as predicted 50 years ago.' \n'Science.http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/259342-fifty-years-ago-the-white-house-knew-all-about-climate"", 'In addition to the Industrial Revolution\'s obvious increase of carbon in the atmosphere causing the ""screeching halt"" of the next ice age, it should be noted that humans have already been exerting their impact on the climate in a gentler, even beneficial way.  The Milankovich cycles suggest that there should have been an 8000 year decline, were it not for the human introduction of agriculture.  William Ruddiman, paleoclimatologist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Virginia suggests that the unprecedented leveling of our CO2 levels and climate have been the result of humans gradually removing carbon sinks from the planet -- our forests, in the name of agriculture.  Since most mass extinction of species happen when there are drastic changes in climate, we have unwittingly been performing a service to biodiversity by being controllers of a biological thermostat.  Of course, that was less than one billion people, and there arises biodiversity issues with loss of forest habitats. Although the Industrial Revolution added 0.6 degrees to the world climate, Ruddiman points out that agriculture has gradually created a differential of 0.8 degrees from where the Milankovich cycles suggested we\'d be!  That means two things -- first, we can stop beating ourselves up over being apart from nature -- nature (with God at the helm, if you will) has enlisted us as keepers of the biothermostat!  Second, we have an incredibly powerful tool in modulating both agriculture and deforestation/reforestation, and mitigating fossil fuels isn\'t the only tool in humanity\'s global cooling kit.  Our choice of food is the key factor in this modulation -- with the crisis created by industrialization (primarily by the energy sector but also by agriculture).  If agriculture could be responsible for adding 0.8 degrees to cancel the ice age, we can also cancel a significant portion of the climate crisis by eliminating animals from our diet.  How fast can we do it?  It\'s something that I\'ve already done and it\'s something that you can do today.  The fight to keep oil in the ground must continue -- in fact, we may need to have some fossil fuels left in our thermostat tool kit several hundred years from now when the Milankovich cycles start to push that ice age even harder.  Whenever anyone talks about geoengineering most methods are treacherous and uncertain.  Technology has given us the means to measure our planet\'s fever (hear that Mr. Trump?  We still need NASA) and use an all-natural remedy -- reforestation and elimination of food animals.  http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v292/n3/box/scientificamerican0305-46_BX4.html', 'Education about the subject of global warming/climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our day.

Where adults could enjoy the hard-earned fruits of their labor, be it physical or mental. That also means the right to move about whenever one chooses, not to be constrained to a bus/train schedule. It lent to the creation of shopping centers, where accessibility to many goods and services were possible. Later on, home delivery/serviceability made living even easier. The 'nuclear family' jargon was identified with suburban living, where families could be able to make their own way, without the prying eyes and ears of others. \n\nIt's not surprising that some have a disdain for such living, usually those that are younger, more socially inclined. It is when one gets older, better employed and more settled that wants to occupy something with more room for a family to grow besides a town home or a semi-detatched house. Even if that person or couple were to be employed in a major or secondary city, personal transportation will still serve these people.

They broke barriers and changed perceptions in the process.

Trump ended the major on going wars in the Middle East. \xa0\n\nTrump came up with a Palestine settlement.  It didn\'t look very attractive for the land distribution of Palestine, but it may have been negotiable.  I very much doubt there will be another such offer in people\'s life times.

This was especially difficult for the railroad industry because only Nippon steel of Japan was now making the low nitrogen steel used in modern rail.  The import tariff added 25% to that steel.\n\nI don\'t know why politicians just don\'t come out and say it, but noncondensing greenhouse gas behavior such as from carbon dioxide doesn\'t warm the planet!

If water vapor were the only greenhouse gas in the atmosphere it would still hold earth\'s greenhouse effect in heavy saturation.  Adding more greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere can not cause earth\'s greenhouse effect to retain anymore temperature.  The UN IPCC reports state clearly they only sampled their greenhouse gases at 20 thousand meters altitude far into the stratosphere where water vapor is near zero.

It doesn\'t.  \xa0\n\nAl Gore when he became vise president in 1992 made it federal policy that human caused carbon dioxide emissions were causing global warming.  That policy was made to spread far and wide.  Before Al Gore made the film ""An Inconvenient Truth"" falsely portraying carbon dioxide to be causing global warming when global warming had actually dipped since the early 1990s he had a net worth of a few million dollars.   After getting the fame from portraying carbon dioxide as the cause of global warming his net worth has expanded to well over 100 million dollars.

The changes have no relationship to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. \r\nThe climate crisis/emergency/apocalypse is make-believe.\r\nMultiyear ice is an unproductive habitat as far as marine organisms are concerned: first year (seasonal) ice over continental shelves is the most productive and this is where the vast majority of polar bears, seals, fish, whales, and sea birds are found. Therefore the decline of extremely thick multiyear ice (>4 years old) could be seen as an unconcerning development with regards to the wildlife in the region, especially since 2-3 year old ice that can be used as a resting/hunting platform for seals and polar bears hasn\'t declined in summer since 2007. In fact, biologically, the Arctic is in good shape with all its regions showing a positive trend in primary productivity over an extended period (2003-2022). This has resulted in more food for seals, walruses, bowhead whales and polar bears, which are  hence maintaining or expanding their populations. \r\nThere\'s no ""death spiral"" in the region as some people reported.

This shows that the decline in extent is a clear trend, and that much of the Arctic Ocean is indeed functionally ice free for a significant part of the late summer. \n\nWhat is interesting is the Arctic sea ice extent goes up and down every year and that the Arctic Sea/Arctic Ocean consists of 8 seas, a straight, and a bay with its lowest coverage in September so it makes sense that measurements done in the 30s and 40s are pretty much is irrelevant especially when they were not done in all the regions.

CO2 emission are cumulative....... Within these graphs and observed temperature records it also seems to show that........... for a doubling of CO2 emissions there is a quadrupling of the effect? Is this due to increased release from permafrost CO2 and CH4 due to warming effects....... Or does doubling of emissions force warming at an accelerated pace? Either way, by current data we can see the decadal temperature increase has quadrupled...... Continuation of this trend will see a decadal increase of 1'c per decade for 2020-30 shooting us to the 2'c threshold by 2030........ 2040 and we will be beyond 3'c.....

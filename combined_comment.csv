Frank Baxter of The Bell System Science Series E.g.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHVTQ2fLM0 was first. This alarmist video was plagiarized by Al Gore.\r\n\r\nThe claim that CO2 was a ""heat trapping gas"" was scuttlebutt at that time. Alarmists presented no knowledge of the X10 CO2 level during the late Ordovician while a global glaciation prevailed, as revealed by drop stones in Sahara and Saudi Arabia. CO2 is NOT a ""heat trapping gas"". This claim comes from the \'authority\' of Al Gore, psychopath, businessman. Al Gore took only one science course from Oceanographer Roger Revelle. They argued. Journalism records this snippet of history. Regrettably journalist historians did not report what grade student Al Gore was awarded, while a student at Harvard?\r\n\r\nAs a psychopath businessman Al Gore became excited with the business opportunities provided by Carl Sagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreenhouse‚Äù. Sagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreenhouse‚Äù was repudiated by Carl Sagan himself and his colleague Bishun Khare when they did chemical analysis of ‚ÄòTholin‚Äô, using Infrared Spectroscopy and other techniques. Infrared Spectroscopy deals with Infrared radiation emitted and absorbed. For understanding IR radiation, there are the Beer-Lambert Laws. The absorption depth of IR radiation in air is measured at 1.0 cm. The highway mirage, Forrest M.

As the sun illuminates the pavement, its temperature rises significantly. The hot asphalt then warms a thin layer of air over the pavement. Warm air has a lower index of refraction than cool air.‚Äô\r\n\r\nAl Gore has revealed himself to be an uneducated psychopathic moron. Who would believe what he says? Enough did believe him, that he earned $300 million$ which he invested in Southern California real estate.

It needs a negative buoyancy force. It is inconsistent with the Ideal Gas Law.

Someone needs to look into the emissions model estimates as it is not all that clear cut. Many small holder farmers still have small amounts of livestock that are fed with farm produce that cannot be sold or are farm wastes. Rise in the demand for plant based products actually contributed to more farm produce that cannot be sold - consumers usually only pick the nice shiny ones and those that do not make the quality cut are processed or fed to livestock. As for farm wastes, rice bran for example is mixed with feed and rather than letting it decompose, it is used for another purpose to feed animals. This metric on 77% of land used to create 18% of calories also needs to be reviewed since a lot of feed inputs are again wastes being used for another purpose. The opportunity cost way of looking at this problem does not include waste management being used for some other purpose (as input to another process). There are many other examples of farm wastes being used as inputs for animal feed. Then there is the issue of livestock being used in the farm not just to produce meat but as part of the ecosystem - keeping grass cut as to not make an environment for snakes to thrive or ducks eating snails to control snail rice pests. In this case livestock is actually a contributor to make soil richer and make the farm more biodiverse. As for biotechnology on growing meat, how will that play in developing countries? Foster more import culture? Well... there goes accumulation of wealth. This is one of those things that are in the not so simple in life category.']"

The carbon tax has not reduced emissions AT ALL.  In fact emissions have increased.  The trick they use is it was reduced from ""what it would have been"" ie from a computer projection based on past consumption (a guess) that did not take into account other factors that also reduce consumption.  Yes, lower income households do get some more money back, but the fact of the matter is the ""rich"" actually pay less anyway as they leave during winter to warm jurisdictions and avoid the carbon tax anyway (we tend to refer to these people as snow birds).  So who really pays....  The working middle class.  What has the carbon tax really done?  It is a SIGNIFICANT contributor to inflation and the high cost of living particularly in BC. As part of that those who can now burn wood and/or garbage for fuel sources.  These are ""unofficial"" CO2 sources so the ""official"" consumption has gone down, but at best the actual CO2 production is the same or more considering burning wood or garbage for fuel is very inefficient.  It has also significantly contributed to cross boarder shopping mostly into Norther Washington USA where the fuel and products are much more affordable even with our low dollar taken into account.  Other problems are healthy foods like fresh vegetables have gone up significantly in price because of the transport costs.   Forcing families to either forgo or eat (ironically) more processed less healthy foods.  And the high cost of living (among several other factors) has also lead to the extremely high homeless and drug problem in Vancouver in particular.  The economy grew in BC due to demand in LNG and other natural resources (BC has a large forestry industry), and tech centers in Vancouver.  It has not grown as much as it could have mostly due to high taxes, and Provincial and Federal political policies that have limited the economy.  It is above the Canadian average, but it always has been.  I note you did not mention Quebec who also has a carbon tax, but due to it\'s welfare state policies and the rest of Canada\'s monetary support it does not have the higher cost of living, but it also has a stagnant economy.

Someone needs to look into the emissions model estimates as it is not all that clear cut. Many small holder farmers still have small amounts of livestock that are fed with farm produce that cannot be sold or are farm wastes. Rise in the demand for plant based products actually contributed to more farm produce that cannot be sold - consumers usually only pick the nice shiny ones and those that do not make the quality cut are processed or fed to livestock. As for farm wastes, rice bran for example is mixed with feed and rather than letting it decompose, it is used for another purpose to feed animals. This metric on 77% of land used to create 18% of calories also needs to be reviewed since a lot of feed inputs are again wastes being used for another purpose. The opportunity cost way of looking at this problem does not include waste management being used for some other purpose (as input to another process). There are many other examples of farm wastes being used as inputs for animal feed. Then there is the issue of livestock being used in the farm not just to produce meat but as part of the ecosystem - keeping grass cut as to not make an environment for snakes to thrive or ducks eating snails to control snail rice pests. In this case livestock is actually a contributor to make soil richer and make the farm more biodiverse. As for biotechnology on growing meat, how will that play in developing countries? Foster more import culture? Well... there goes accumulation of wealth. This is one of those things that are in the not so simple in life category.']"

The carbon tax has not reduced emissions AT ALL.  In fact emissions have increased.  The trick they use is it was reduced from ""what it would have been"" ie from a computer projection based on past consumption (a guess) that did not take into account other factors that also reduce consumption.  Yes, lower income households do get some more money back, but the fact of the matter is the ""rich"" actually pay less anyway as they leave during winter to warm jurisdictions and avoid the carbon tax anyway (we tend to refer to these people as snow birds).  So who really pays....  The working middle class.  What has the carbon tax really done?  It is a SIGNIFICANT contributor to inflation and the high cost of living particularly in BC. As part of that those who can now burn wood and/or garbage for fuel sources.  These are ""unofficial"" CO2 sources so the ""official"" consumption has gone down, but at best the actual CO2 production is the same or more considering burning wood or garbage for fuel is very inefficient.  It has also significantly contributed to cross boarder shopping mostly into Norther Washington USA where the fuel and products are much more affordable even with our low dollar taken into account.  Other problems are healthy foods like fresh vegetables have gone up significantly in price because of the transport costs.   Forcing families to either forgo or eat (ironically) more processed less healthy foods.  And the high cost of living (among several other factors) has also lead to the extremely high homeless and drug problem in Vancouver in particular.  The economy grew in BC due to demand in LNG and other natural resources (BC has a large forestry industry), and tech centers in Vancouver.  It has not grown as much as it could have mostly due to high taxes, and Provincial and Federal political policies that have limited the economy.  It is above the Canadian average, but it always has been.  I note you did not mention Quebec who also has a carbon tax, but due to it\'s welfare state policies and the rest of Canada\'s monetary support it does not have the higher cost of living, but it also has a stagnant economy.

Your videos help to keep our eyes focused on the critical reasons why we need to co-create better solutions.  As individuals, communities, nations, and as residents on our one-and-only planet, we desperately need a much better accounting of our living energy currency, - not just an accounting of our monetary currency.\n\nThe currency of all life here on Earth is ‚Äúliving energy.‚Äù  The living energy in our soils, and water, is needed to give birth to the plants humans need for survival.  Without that living energy, our soils would become only dirt and sand. Without soil biology, it becomes only geology - like Mars.  The valuable living energy currency of individual human beings is being devalued, wasted, and diverted.  The accounting valuation of monetary currency, increasingly devalues our living energy currency.  Our currency accounting system does not reflect the reality of what it takes for humanity to co-creatively sustain human life, on our planet.  Our current currency strategy is increasingly moving to a self-destructive goal, of increasingly devaluing all living energy currency.  \n\nLike a doctor, who only sees the symptoms, and waits for the test results, for a diagnosis, we are all sharing an experience of the awkward transition time of conscious (rather than unconscious) ignorance.  It‚Äôs also a time just before beautiful transitions for healing and marvelous new discoveries.\n\nAll of our ‚Äúliving energy currency‚Äù (environmental and human) is being severely depleted by climate change.  Past, present and future examples of an Economics of Compassion have protected our most valuable living energy currency.  For our present, and our future, we need to find many more, and better ways, for our monetary currency to support, and not threaten, our living energy currency.  \n\nPersonally, I‚Äôd love to explore a possibility of an individually-initiated economic currency, which would better enable human co-creative living energy currency. Individually initiated economic currency would be a biomimicry of the way each cell in our body has some limited degree of autonomy.  I wrote about this idea in our TTWalks message board in 2012 and called it a Jobs-Card, or J-Card.  It‚Äôs still online for anyone interested in Googling it.  I think this would better enable individual responses to co-creatively support both an environmental and human Economics of Compassion.

That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible!  Also, bear in mind, that Water Vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas.  CO2 is only 5% of the earth's GHG; Water Vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.    Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El Nino) and oceans degas.  Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.  Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and Not a Thermostat."", 'This was good to mention the global warming benefits northern countries, we count too. Also if we eliminate global warming we will introduce another iced age. How much fun does that sound. ?', 'Katherine, despite your many great talks, I have to disagree with you (and probably most others) regarding CO2 being a pollutant.  Atmospheric pollutants are ""substances that accumulate in the air to a degree that is directly harmful to living organisms or to materials exposed to the air"".  CO2, at 420 ppm at present, does not \'directly\' harm living organisms exposed to the air. Rather, it helps warm the planet, and its the heat energy that is impacting negatively on living organisms.  CO2 is, after all, essential for all life on Earth.  We would not have O2 were it not for CO2 and the photosynthesis process. Plants came before all animals and insects, because it was CO2 that eventually provided enough O2 for animals to evolve.  CO2, prior to humans producing far too much through fossil fuels, helped keep Earth\'s climate in balance, around 15 degs. C.  Without GHGs, Earth\'s mean global temperature would hover around -20 degs. C, and life as we know it could not exist. \n\nFurthermore, water vapour, yes H2O, makes up about 50% of all GHGs. If global temperatures increased by 2 degs C, say from 15 to 17C, then H2O vapour would increased by almost 25%, which might be enough to put the climate over the top.  Therefore, if CO2 is a pollutant, then you must also include H2O vapour as a pollutant.  Where wpuld that leave you?  You should not lump CO2, H2O, and N2O in the same category of pollutants as CO,  SO2, and NO2.  I cannot fathom labelling something essential to all life as a pollutant!

The Earth\'s temperature very quickly spikes up 8 to 15 degrees Celcius, followed by at least 10,000 years of relatively stable warm temperatures.  This is then followed by a rapid decline in temperature leading to 80,000 to 90,000 years of glaciation where half of North America is covered by glaciers, during which time the Earth slowly gets colder.  Then the cycle repeats.  The last time we experienced rapid warming was about 11,000 years ago.  All of human civilization arose during this brief warm period, thanks in part to the fertile crescent in the Middle East making grains more available.\r\n\r\nWe should be in the cool-down phase by now, but anthropogenic greenhouse gases have at least temporarily delayed it.  It was predicted in the 1970s that we were entering a new ice age.  A period from 1500 to 1850 has been labeled ""the little ice age"", however, atmospheric CO2 levels started to go up in the 1800s.  Some have said that no matter what we do we can\'t avoid the next period of mass glaciation roughly 10,00 years from now, while others have suggested that we can delay it.  Previous ice ages have caused massive declines in the human population.\r\n\r\nThese temperature cycles are caused by the roughly 5 different Malankovich cycles aligning with each other to produce rapid warming.  These cycles affect the Earth\'s orbit and its axial tilt.  The Earth is currently halfway between its maximum tilt and its minimum tilt, which has a 41,000-year cycle.  At the maximum tilt, the glaciers melt more, reducing the Earth\'s albedo, which means that less sunlight is reflected into space.  The increasing temperatures cause the oceans to release more of their stored CO2 into the atmosphere, which creates a temporary positive feedback loop.  The warming effect of CO2 in the atmosphere is logarithmic, which means that it reaches a saturation point, producing a temporarily stable warm climate.\r\n\r\nI don\'t understand why the cycle is every 100,000 years instead of every 41,000 years, and the Wikipedia article talks about this being an ""issue"" that they don\'t understand.  Prior to about 3 million years ago, the cycle was every 41,000 years.

Also, I really think this could provide us with protection against a disaster so bad that global warming and nuclear war might seem minor in comparison, i.e., a major volcanic eruption, the size of the Krakatoa eruption of more than a 100 years ago or much bigger. As I understand it, the tectonic plate system that includes Yellowstone has been rebounding with the huge amount of melting of glaciers over it. Also, fracking is going on around Yellowstone, with resulting frequent earthquakes. A large eruption of Yellowstone can‚Äôt be ruled out within our lifetimes. And as bad as the ash, pyroclastic flow, and fire would be, it seems that the real killer is the huge release of sulfates into the stratosphere, where they could cause a decade or so of up to several degrees Celsius of cooling. We have to remember that this means many more killing frosts in particular, and that this could even be an extinction event comparable to the eruption of the Mount Toba volcan 75,000 years ago, which is \n widely believed to have killed off most of humanity, as well as other plants and animals. It seems likely to me that this could be easily offset just by having CO2 reversibly sequestered in the many underground caverns on the planet, including those created by the fossil fuel companies in the course of removing vast amounts of oil.

For developing hurricanes, this means more intense precipitation‚Äîsome 20 percent higher rainfall rates, according to Knutson‚Äôs calculations.

The Milankovich cycles suggest that there should have been an 8000 year decline, were it not for the human introduction of agriculture.  William Ruddiman, paleoclimatologist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Virginia suggests that the unprecedented leveling of our CO2 levels and climate have been the result of humans gradually removing carbon sinks from the planet -- our forests, in the name of agriculture.  Since most mass extinction of species happen when there are drastic changes in climate, we have unwittingly been performing a service to biodiversity by being controllers of a biological thermostat.  Of course, that was less than one billion people, and there arises biodiversity issues with loss of forest habitats. Although the Industrial Revolution added 0.6 degrees to the world climate, Ruddiman points out that agriculture has gradually created a differential of 0.8 degrees from where the Milankovich cycles suggested we\'d be!  That means two things -- first, we can stop beating ourselves up over being apart from nature -- nature (with God at the helm, if you will) has enlisted us as keepers of the biothermostat!  Second, we have an incredibly powerful tool in modulating both agriculture and deforestation/reforestation, and mitigating fossil fuels isn\'t the only tool in humanity\'s global cooling kit.  Our choice of food is the key factor in this modulation -- with the crisis created by industrialization (primarily by the energy sector but also by agriculture).  If agriculture could be responsible for adding 0.8 degrees to cancel the ice age, we can also cancel a significant portion of the climate crisis by eliminating animals from our diet.  How fast can we do it?  It\'s something that I\'ve already done and it\'s something that you can do today.  The fight to keep oil in the ground must continue -- in fact, we may need to have some fossil fuels left in our thermostat tool kit several hundred years from now when the Milankovich cycles start to push that ice age even harder.  Whenever anyone talks about geoengineering most methods are treacherous and uncertain.  Technology has given us the means to measure our planet\'s fever (hear that Mr. Trump?  We still need NASA) and use an all-natural remedy -- reforestation and elimination of food animals.  http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v292/n3/box/scientificamerican0305-46_BX4.html', 'Education about the subject of global warming/climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our day.

Not without some effort of mass production we haven't seen since WWII. And even if we did, it would still be inadequate. Global energy demand is set to increase 50% in the next 30 years according to the IEA - and that increase in demand will be met by fossil fuels - minus a puff of wind. If we do that anyway, we will have to do it all again in 20 years - the approximate working lifetime of a wind turbine. \nAlternatively, we could cooperate to harness Magma Energy - as described by Nasa/Sandia Labs, 1982 - a source of constant high grade clean energy so vast, it can meet global energy demand many times over. \nWith a not dissimilar expenditure of political will and resources, we could tap into a source of energy more than able to meet all our needs carbon free; it could also supply an abundance of surplus energy necessary to desalinate, irrigate, recycle, capture carbon etc. \nOver the next 50 years, rather than imposing politically unpopular demand side restrictions striving toward Net Zero, Magma Energy/ electrical power/ hydrogen fuel could be fed into the economy from the supply side, big industrial energy users first, reducing emissions, and supporting the economy through the transition to a prosperous and sustainable future."", 'Heres to these becoming a reality', 'i can become the plasma my self given you do what i say afterwards :D']"

You see where I'm going with this? You can prohibit fixing everything if you want, but you can also find alternatives. Make bamboo straws bendable. Problem solved, the planet maybe after all DOESN'T need to be destroyed and all it took was a second to think about it. Making an excuse right now why bamboo can't be bendable? I thought so.

This was especially difficult for the railroad industry because only Nippon steel of Japan was now making the low nitrogen steel used in modern rail.

After getting the fame from portraying carbon dioxide as the cause of global warming his net worth has expanded to well over 100 million dollars.

The changes have no relationship to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. \r\nThe climate crisis/emergency/apocalypse is make-believe.\r\nMultiyear ice is an unproductive habitat as far as marine organisms are concerned: first year (seasonal) ice over continental shelves is the most productive and this is where the vast majority of polar bears, seals, fish, whales, and sea birds are found. Therefore the decline of extremely thick multiyear ice (>4 years old) could be seen as an unconcerning development with regards to the wildlife in the region, especially since 2-3 year old ice that can be used as a resting/hunting platform for seals and polar bears hasn\'t declined in summer since 2007. In fact, biologically, the Arctic is in good shape with all its regions showing a positive trend in primary productivity over an extended period (2003-2022). This has resulted in more food for seals, walruses, bowhead whales and polar bears, which are  hence maintaining or expanding their populations. \r\nThere\'s no ""death spiral"" in the region as some people reported.

This shows that the decline in extent is a clear trend, and that much of the Arctic Ocean is indeed functionally ice free for a significant part of the late summer. \n\nWhat is interesting is the Arctic sea ice extent goes up and down every year and that the Arctic Sea/Arctic Ocean consists of 8 seas, a straight, and a bay with its lowest coverage in September so it makes sense that measurements done in the 30s and 40s are pretty much is irrelevant especially when they were not done in all the regions.

Is this due to increased release from permafrost CO2 and CH4 due to warming effects....... Or does doubling of emissions force warming at an accelerated pace?
